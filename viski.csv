75,McAfee’s Benchmark Old No. 8,40,Bourbon/Tennessee,12,"Freshly cut oak and chewing tobacco to start, followed by hints of green apple, wood chips, and a warm, wet sharpening stone. On the palate, the wood heightens and becomes extremely bitter. This whiskey’s saving grace is that it’s extremely palatable in cocktails.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
76,Sunshine Reserve American whiskey,42.5,American Blended Whiskey,50,"Raw oak, drywall, campfire, and glue open the sinuses. Then, an antiseptic/medicinal property sets in with tobacco, burnt wood, and smoked paprika. Toward the end, a generous helping of vanilla kicks in over a decent finish to save it.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
79,Barrell Rye (Batch 002),58.75,Rye Whiskey,90,"Oak comes out strong and dominates. Its astringency appears to mask everything else for a moment, just before tobacco, dark chocolate, peanut butter, and sesame seeds set in. Unfortunately, these notes surface only briefly before the oak barrage reappears. It’s simply over-oaked.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
79,O.Z. Tyler Rye,44.9,Rye Whiskey,23,"Aromas of lumber, wood spice, and butterscotch give way to pencil shavings, toasted sawdust, and cloying sweetness on the palate. Gentle baking spice and cherry flavors aren’t enough to redeem the assault of wood.

Processing: Distilled in Kentucky and aged in new charred oak barrels before undergoing the TerrePURE process.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2018
79,Dry Fly Straight Bourbon 101,50.50,Craft Whiskey,60,"Lots of char and burnt sugar on the nose, leading to some sweet fruit on the palate, with coffee and mocha on the finish. Vanilla cream candies are overwhelmed by a woodpile of oak, drying tannins, and heat that lack balance. Multiple tastings with consistent results.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
80,Omar Sherry Cask-Finished Single Malt,46,Taiwanese Whisky,90,"The bottle may project a Tolkienesque image of a craft distillery run by Bilbo Baggins, but this is produced at Taiwan’s state-owned Nantou Distillery. This lacks sweetness and structure. The meaty nose has prune juice, star anise, lamb tagine, and predominant sour notes throughout the syrupy-textured palate, with flavors of raspberry syrup, pomegranate, and gummy cherries, then tame spices and jumbled savory notes.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
80,Alberta Premium,40,Canadian,20,"When high-rye whisky seemed doomed, some hard-bit fans longed to taste a simple mixer called Alberta Premium. With few ryes to compare, reviewers assessed this all-rye grain whisky generously. Today, with rye whisky booming and rye’s flavor diversity understood, opinions are more informed. Enjoy the caramels, mild wood, light peppery rye spices, and ginger of this old-style 100% rye by a campfire or in a Highball. (<em>Canada only</em>) $27 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
80,Old Grand-Dad,40,Bourbon/Tennessee,17,"An odd combo of cornbread and pine trees starts this whiskey just before the grains develop. Think rye bread, oatmeal, and barley. Then it’s caramel and vanilla before a blast of cinnamon. This whiskey is far too soft and short to hold up as a sipper. It’s best in batched cocktails.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
80,Cleveland Underground Bourbon Finished with Apple Wood,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Juicy Fruit gum, Kool-Aid, sugared orange gumdrops, and candied papaya and mango meet fresh-cut lumber on the nose. The palate has notes of bruised banana and juicy guava, with assertive wood and cocoa powder to balance the sweetness.

80,MacQueen’s 3 year old,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,13,"MacQueen’s has an impressive range of age statement blends, but this is the youngest one. Faint caramel and toast, a mild rub of whole spice, and snuff tobacco. The mouthfeel is meager and lacks any real punch; there is spice and fudge, but little sweetness. More caramel flavors develop alongside chocolate notes before a dry, quick finish. There are better options around, even at this price.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
81,Creek Water American Whiskey,50,American Whiskey (Unspecified),25,"Sweet kettle corn and caramel-covered nuts on the nose, along with a smoky and woody aroma—dry toasted wood on a fire. The palate is led by sugary grain and wood char, with caramel corn and grilled corn on the cob, along with a hint of wood spice. It’s cloying and sweet on the finish, yet retains strong oakiness. Distilled from a bourbon mash and “finished” with toasted wood chips using a proprietary technology.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
81,Cleveland Underground Bourbon Finished with Hickory Wood,47,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Grassy aromas mingle with white pepper, honeysuckle, jasmine, and newsprint on the nose. The palate rushes through sweet vanilla-cake and ripe fruit flavors, with strong oak and alcohol influence, to a finish that is mostly wood with some pleasant chocolate and herbal notes. Disjointed at times, but water helps bring it together.

81,Boatwright Single Barrel Bourbon,45,Craft Whiskey,55,"Grassy notes and damp hay define the aroma of this young bourbon, while the palate offers good citrus and orchard fruits. However, there is a varnish note and stalky green character that hold it back. Needs time.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
82,Ko‘olau Old Pali Road Whiskey (Batch 001),43,American Whiskey (Unspecified),45,"The nose is floral and grain-forward, with green banana, lemon pith, Honey Nut Cheerios, and wood spice. On the palate, sweet whipped cream and lemon are overlaid by white pepper and Popsicle stick. It finishes hot and dry. A blend of whiskey made from a bourbon mash by Ko‘olau Distillery and 5 year old whiskey from Missouri.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
82,Bondi Bourbon,40,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Yes, this is named for the beach in Australia, and its light character might well be intended for seaside sipping. Orange blossom, lemon, and cinnamon gum vie with Popsicle stick on the nose. The light-bodied palate has more orange, cinnamon candy, nuttiness, and a lot of oak that becomes cloying on the finish. Overall, it has the effect of making one wish there were just a bit more body and character.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
82,Trader Joe’s Rum Cask Finish Highland,40,Single Malt Scotch,20,"Somewhat vegetal on the nose, with stewed fruit, licorice, tarragon, ginger, butterscotch, and hazelnuts. More stewed fruit, salted licorice, and hazelnuts appear on the palate, along with white pepper, clove, and bitter oak. An abrupt whisky whose better characteristics are muddied by the first-fill rum cask finish. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
82,Noble Oak Bourbon (prototype),45,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"The caramel on the nose is a bit strange and chemical, but the palate offers promise with its pleasing spice, sweetness, orange peel, chocolate, and silky mouthfeel. There are lovely flavors, but the oak feels layered on rather than integrated.

82,O.Z. Tyler Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,20,"Wood spice dominates the nose, with citrus, floral, and tobacco barn aromas. The palate has pleasant orange peel, spice, red apple, and vanilla notes with a robust heat; however, toasted oak continues to reign. One for the wood lover.

83,Cask & Crew Blended Rye (Batch 1),40,Rye Whiskey,25,"A blend of 51% 3 year old Canadian rye and 49% aged American corn whiskey. It has aromas of peanut shell, tea leaf, dill, mint, Popsicle stick, and bags of grain at the general store. The light-bodied palate is redolent of pencil shavings, chamomile, dried Turkish mint, and oaky spice, finishing very quickly.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
83,Still Austin Bourbon,50,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Citrus oil, freshly cut wood, tea leaves, baking spice, and maple candy on the nose; with water added, more herbal and floral notes emerge, including mint, star anise, and fresh chamomile. Medium-bodied, the palate has orange peel, licorice, star anise, brown sugar, and plenty of fresh oak; here, adding water doesn&#039;t benefit the balance. It finishes quickly, with black pepper, oak, and more star anise.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
83,Firestone & Robertson TX Straight Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Led by raw grain and new oak on the nose, it also has aromas of cedar, spiced almonds, green banana, and marshmallow. The palate shows plenty of wood, with pulling tannins, as well as black pepper, vanilla, orange, and bitter almond. It’s more oak and grain on the finish, which fades quickly. Some promising qualities here, but this whiskey needs more time in the barrel.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
83,Spirits of French Lick Lee W. Sinclair Four Grain Straight Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Made with an unusual mashbill—corn, wheat, caramel malt, and oats—this whiskey was aged for 2 years. Grain, bread dough, almond paste, and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. The palate has fresh wood shavings, cinnamon, bread dough, orange Popsicle, and walnuts, with a dry chocolate and oak finish. A bit more maturation time should soften some of the youthful edges.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
83,Catoctin Creek Rabble Rouser Bottled in Bond Rye,50,Rye Whiskey,90,"Peanut taffy, licorice, black pepper, tarragon, and lemon vie with Popsicle stick and a bit of solvent on the nose. The palate is laden with herbs—anise, licorice, tarragon, and basil—as well as cubeb, black pepper, and cough syrup. There are some enjoyable flavors here, but heavy-handed oak throws things off-balance.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
83,Darby’s Reserve Small Batch,45,Rye Whiskey,22,"Roasted lemon and orange peels, grilled apples, nutmeg, ginger, and Popsicle stick on the nose. Citrus-flavored hard candies, cinnamon, cloves, iced tea, apple skins, and drying wood on the palate, which takes water well. This is simple, wood-forward, and immature, but the flavors are pleasant. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
83,Braddock Oak Single Barrel (Batch #T517K6),46,Rye Whiskey,40,"With spearmint, licorice, dried flowers, cedar, and new oak on the nose, it’s no surprise to taste a wood-forward palate. Iced tea with orange peel, spearmint, grain, sweet cedar, and drying oak lead into a finish of menthol, dark cocoa, and shoe polish. Youthful, with some rough edges, but enjoyable. Distilled by Catoctin Creek from 100% rye. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
83,Cleveland Black Reserve Bourbon,50,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"The nose is grainy with strong wood notes and hints of vanilla, lilac, and cinnamon candies. Flavors of caramel, vanilla, spice, and citrus tussle with cedar, tea leaves, and oak tannins before a lengthy, assertive finish of tobacco, caramel, cinnamon, clove, and orange peel.

83,Relativity American Whisky (prototype),40,American Whiskey (Unspecified),35,"Generously woody with pencil shavings and lumber mingled with chamomile, white flowers, and vanilla on the nose.

84,Coppersea Excelsior Straight Bourbon (Batch 1901),48,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Overripe fruit, orange Creamsicle (and its stick), cedar oil, and wood spice on the nose. The palate is tannic with robust orange, oak, cinnamon, cherry Luden’s cough drops, and herbal cough syrup. It finishes on oak, chocolate, nuts, and cinnamon—a bit hot, but softened with generous water.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
84,Basil Hayden’s Caribbean Reserve Rye Finished with Rum,40,Miscellaneous,50,"Not a rum cask-finished rye, but a blend of Kentucky straight rye with Canadian rye and added blackstrap rum. The experience is sweet from start to finish: Sugar Babies and their parent Sugar Daddy on the nose, along with molasses, raisins, kettle corn, maple donuts, toasted marshmallow, and a little grassiness on the nose. The palate is sugary-sweet, with molasses, pralines, coffee ice cream, Raisinets, and some bitter oak, and it finishes short. Keep an eye on your blood sugar when drinking this.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
84,Doc Swinson’s Rum Cask-Finished Rye (Release 02,"Barrel 09), 45",Rye Whiskey,30,"Fruity and earthy on the nose, with orange Fanta, mixed berry compote, lemon drops, chamomile tea, fragrant oak, and caraway. The palate is sweet and gently herbal, with orange oil, cinnamon candy, chocolate, old-fashioned cough drops, and spearmint. Cinnamon-spiced pecans, chocolate, and sweet oak on the relatively short finish. This is simple but tasty—a painting in primary colors.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
84,Blinking Owl California Straight Bourbon (Batch 3),45,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"The barrel shows itself up front: cigar box, fresh pencils, dried chili, allspice, and tea leaves, along with a touch of honeydew. The palate is roasty and oak-driven: chili powder, cacao, roasted nuts, and savory, salty grilled meat. An austere finish, with white pepper, dry oak, and cocoa powder.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
84,Buckshee Straight Rye,45,Rye Whiskey,42,"The nose starts out with orange blossom, lemon zest, licorice, iced tea, and confectioners’ sugar, set against pine forest notes and a hint of minerality. The palate is light, with orange pekoe tea, vanilla, baked apples and cloves, and more pine. The finish is also light and somewhat brief, with pleasurable notes of spice, as well as figs, brown sugar, and an overlay of white pepper. Some interesting notes on offer.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
84,Savage & Cooke The Burning Chair Bourbon,44,Bourbon/Tennessee,55,"Light in aroma, with nougat, pistachio halvah, fresh lilies, and the chalkiness of general store candy. Flavor and mouthfeel are also subtle, sometimes too much so; while there are lovely floral and fruit notes, along with spices, pistachio, toasted grain, and orange oil, a bit more amplitude would go a long way.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
84,Murray McDavid 2010 Peatside 6 year old,46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,80,"The nose is pleasant, with fresh strawberry, spicy smoke, cookie dough, allspice, and glacé cherry, but the palate fails to shine or excite. This has been finished in port and Pedro Ximénez casks, giving the whisky a subtle rose hue, but it needs more body. There are flavors of biscuit, mandarin, vanilla, and redcurrant. It meanders along with a fairly flat trajectory, then hits the buffers with some lingering rosehip fruitiness. (2,266 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
84,Devils River Small Batch Texas Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"The nose begins with lemon and lime, followed by notes of licorice root and dill. The palate is smoother and sweeter, if a bit light, with notes of cherry, chocolate, cinnamon, and new oak. The addition of water reveals flavors of orange pekoe tea, peanut shells, a richer note of chocolate, and a dusting of chili powder. Some barrel influence on the palate, but the finish concludes with chocolate, sassafras, and bitter almond oil.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
84,Basil Hayden’s Dark Rye,40,Miscellaneous,40,"A blend of American rye, Canadian rye, and port. Gentle spice and sweet vanilla appear on the nose, but the impression of browning apple, wet leaves, and oxidized red wine are somewhat dreary. Simple and sweet up front, it feels thin, like fake maple syrup, with more sweet vanilla carried on a rather light body, almost resembling some rice whiskies.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
84,Duncan Taylor Octave (distilled at North British) 2009 9 year old,52,Single Grain Whisky,80,"Sharp citrus notes, like an unruly spritz of grapefruit juice first thing in the morning. This is an assertive dram with aromas of lemon bonbon, sour fruits, toffee, fruit sodas, and a whiff of potions and unguents wafting from the back room of a pharmacy. It floats between sweet and sour fruits, settling on a sweet lemon mush wedged between some nibbling spices.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
84,Spirits of French Lick The Wheater Straight Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"A blend of two straight bourbons—a pot still expression from Spirits of French Lick, double distilled and aged 2 years, and a pot-and-column still bourbon sourced from a Wyoming distillery, aged 7 years. A youthful nose is grain-forward and restrained, with notes of dried leaves, crushed juniper berries, and licorice. A palate of bitter orange and black tea, finishing with clove, baking spices, bitter chocolate, and baked apple.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
84,Stone Breaker Blended Whiskey,46,Multinational Whisky,46,"From Restless Spirits of Kansas City, Missouri, a blend of 4 year old Irish whiskey and their own-make pot still whiskey. A gentle nose of pine bough, fennel seed, citrus oil, licorice, and potpourri, with a veneer of lemon candy. The palate tastes young but sweet and creamy, blending vanilla, bitter orange, and spicy pepper with a raisiny Chunky bar note and chocolate-covered almonds. Finishes with more chocolate, orange, and a subtle nuttiness.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
84,Dusko Fine Whiskey,40,Spanish Whisky,40,"A dull stewed-fruit note with polished apples, pink blancmange, rose hip, and a dash of spice, but not a very demonstrative whisky. The body is light and flimsy, even for a 3 year old blend, and the palate offers the return of that sweet pink blancmange, light caramel, and the sweetness of candy cigarettes. It crosses the line with late sugary sweetness and a short peppery finish. Life’s all about choices.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
84,Bainbridge Battle Point Organic Wheat,43,Craft Whiskey,60,"A nose of white pepper and spice, as well as salty brine, light sea smoke, and toasted wood, followed by white chocolate, confectionery sweetness, and wild berries. Rich and full on a front palate that’s somewhat youthful, led by notes of vanilla, milk chocolate, marzipan, and treacle, with lemon and almond adding some zest. The finish lingers, with a hint of salinity and toasted wood, as well as light smoke.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
84,Kirkland,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,18/1.75 liter,"Earthy, with corn husk and biscuit dough on the nose, along with cooked apples, white pepper, and a light spice. Honey, almond meal, toasted marshmallow, and a hint of lemon make for a simple, somewhat grainy palate. It finishes short and sweet, with some cinnamon heat. (<em>Costco</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Kirkland 6 year old,40,Canadian,19/1.75 liter,"Sweet, fruity, and floral, with orange-blossom water, Juicy Fruit gum, toasted coconut, and honey. The palate is simple and grain-forward, with vanilla, coconut, and frosted cookie. Light, facile, and very sweet, this whisky won’t satisfy those seeking complexity, but works well for uncomplicated sipping. (<em>Costco</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Cadée Straight Rye,42,Craft Whiskey,40,"Light and delicate characteristics abound. The nose has raspberries and orange peel, along with fresh-cut wood, iced tea, and rose petals. Wood dominates the palate, lifted by gentle spice, rock candy, walnut shell, stewed plums, and grain. The finish is short, with cola, wood, and bread.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Woody Creek Colorado Straight Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,49,"Aromas of spiced orange and lemon, cedar, bubblegum, and caramel spar with the fresh wood aromas of a sawmill. On the palate, ginger, white pepper, and oak are counterbalanced by a wave of sweetness: orange oil, bubblegum, and strawberry-flavored Fruit Roll-Ups. A touch of water benefits this somewhat simple pour.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Ensign Red,40,Canadian,24,"Walk into a pastry shop and inhale the aromas of coconut cake, confectioners’ sugar, lemon cream, almond paste, and vanilla. Then take a sip: coconut custard, slivered almonds, vanilla, and sweet bread dough. The grain whisky is at the forefront here, lending simplicity and insistent sweetness. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,MacQueens of Scotland 3 year old,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,13,"The nose is grassy and light, with some youthful heat, orange blossom, vanilla, coconut, and cedar. A clean palate of lemon, orange, vanilla, banana, and toasted coconut leads into a simple finish of oak and more vanilla. Basic, but well balanced. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Fistful of Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Some pleasant warm cereal notes emerge, like Quaker oats with cinnamon and brown sugar. The palate offers peanuts and spices, however young spirit juts out, with green stick and slightly antiseptic flavors out of synch with the ample toasted oak. Blind tasted twice with consistent notes.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
84,Meyer’s Blend Supérieur,40,French Whisky,35,"Fresh, sharp citrus with lighter elements: floral notes, orange macaroons, and wisps of cotton candy. Lemon peel, tinned mandarin, and tangy grapefruit on the palate, with deeper notes of lemon curd, gooseberry, confectioners’ sugar, and a minor spice note. This delivers a narrow spectrum of flavor for a blend.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
84,Trader Joe’s 8 year old Speyside,40,Single Malt Scotch,20,"If you aren’t expecting it, the herbaceous, grassy, mineral aromas are a surprise, more expected in an agave spirit than a typical Speysider. But there’s something entrancing about the herbal flavors of tarragon, licorice tea, chestnut honey, and saline, which resolve into a lightly sweet, slightly spiced finish. This is unusual, but beguiling. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Trader Joe’s Kentucky Straight Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,17,"The nose is innocuous, with some cinnamon, herbal iced tea, sweet oranges, cedar, and dry oak. Sweet and wood-forward on the palate, it is also drying and hot, with herbal tea, orange oil, chocolate, cinnamon, and cherry cough syrup. While there are flavors to enjoy here, they seem to need more time to fully develop. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
84,Rock Town Arkansas Bourbon,46,Craft Whiskey,35,"Bourbon made with Arkansas corn, soft red winter wheat, and malted barley. White flowers, citrus, fresh dill, and wet cardboard on the nose. The palate is woody and somewhat harsh, with some chocolate, raspberry, and ground pepper flavors. Quite dry, with tannic oak and sticky pine. Bitter oak on the finish. Primarily wood-driven; the oak overpowers the other flavors.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
84,Cascade Blonde American,40,American Whiskey (Unspecified),20,"Oak-forward with gentle sweetness and light in body, this is a simple and enjoyable enough, with straightforward vanilla and toasted nuts. The finish is a touch astringent, as the drying oak tannins slightly overwhelm the modest fruit.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
84,Liberty Pole Peated Bourbon,46,Craft Whiskey,57,"Heat and peat dominate the nose—this is young and fiery, with rubber, bonfire, cedar chest, charred corn, and apple aromas. The palate continues to burn, though with a nice amount of grilled meat, red fruit, and flavored tobacco notes, especially when water is added. Unfortunately, the smoke is not so well-integrated and it shows on the finish, which has a cloying sweet ashiness.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
84,Johnnie Walker Red Label,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"How does this long-established blend shape up on its own without a ginger or soda mixer? Fresh apple juice, a twist of lemon, dried orange peel, peppercorn, cracker bread, and a vegetal spicy note. It gets into its stride with delicious apple, gentle fudge, and good-tempered spices, with cracked black pepper and a little sourness to finish. Mild, agreeably smooth, without any bombast or hullabaloo; it just blends in.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
84,Evan Williams,43,Bourbon/Tennessee,15,"Commonly referred to as Black Label, the color is noticeably dark for a younger,  less than 8 year old product like this. The nose takes it a step forward with burnt  brown sugar, fruit, and cinnamon. But the palate reveals its youth with a mouthful  of grains and acidity. However, it’s saved by final notes of honey, vanilla, caramel,  soft oak, and coconut. A short finish disappoints, but this is a cocktail or cola contender.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
84,Paddy,40,Irish Blended Whiskey,20,"This summons up plenty of snappy grain notes, with green apple, melon rind, and zested lemon bumping into dried chili, green tomato, damp hay bales, and a dose of spice. It’s sweeter than a kitten with a ball of wool: lemon bonbons, toffee, vanilla cream, banana chews, zesty mandarin, apple, butterscotch, pepper, and clove. Sour apple pips, burnt sugar and spice, and some residual vanilla creaminess see it out.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
84,Zackariah Harris,40,Bourbon/Tennessee,12,"Florals and fruit begin a soft and delicate journey. For such a light whiskey, it’s certainly heavy on cherries, stone fruit, apples, and marmalade, followed by toffee, coffee, bananas, and chocolate. A drop of water shows how delicate it is, and the short finish suggests this whiskey would be leaps and bounds better with ten more degrees of proof.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
84,Rieger’s Kansas City Whiskey,46,Craft Whiskey,40,"Seems to show good maturity on the nose, with nutty, herbal, woody, and husky grain aromas. The notes of warm porridge with brown sugar portend the sweet palate, almost cloying with ripe red fruits. Warm, chocolaty, and spicy, but the somewhat hot finish and dusty oak floorboard quality don’t leave the best lasting impression.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
84,North of 7,45,Canadian,47,"A mash of 95% local rye and 5% malted barley is distilled on the grain, then matured for 3-plus years in new, custom toasted, full-sized bourbon barrels. Expect loads of vanilla and bold barrel notes over dry grass and nutty clean grain. Despite the hot, spicy intensity, lovely mild sweet lemon notes come right to the front. Bottled barrel by barrel, so expect some minor variability. Look for a red stripe on the label. (Canada only) $60 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
84,Jack Daniel’s Rye,45,Rye Whiskey,27,"What begins as a banana, oat, and Malt-O-Meal delight turns into honey and potato chips. This is followed by cookie dough, dark cherries, sweet-potato chips, beets, dehydrated pineapple, pine nuts, and oak. Its medium finish offers a mouthful of banana. If you love banana, you’ll love this whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
84,John Barr Reserve,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"This blend has been a Whyte and MacKay whisky for 25 years. The nose has spice, toffee, wheat biscuits, and smoke, but the combination feels a little benign. The palate is jammy, lightweight, and middle-of-the-road. With a backbone of grain, there are flavors of graham cracker, chocolate ganache, well-baked fruitcake, banoffee pie, smoke, and dried peels, with a burst of spices on the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
84,Tanner’s Creek Blended Bourbon,42.5,American Blended Whiskey,35,"It begins with flowers, cardamom, fresh-cut walnut wood, and mint. Notes of fruit, pomace, applesauce, pineapple, and vanilla-iced strawberries take over, but smoke, pear, and apple dominate thereafter. A shorter than expected finish presents hints of chocolate, candied corn, and more smoke. Very nice for punches.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
84,The Pogues,40,Blended Irish Whiskey,40,"Named for the greatest London-Irish band of the 1980s, this produces stewed apple, raisin, vanilla cream, peppercorn, grated nutmeg, and a dirty ol’ mound of dunnage earth. A fiesta of apple, pineapple, grapefruit, bitter lemon, subdued honey, and caramel transition into stewed apples, rhubarb, lemon bonbons, and sweet vanilla. Lingering bitterness, like the band’s split. It’s a Big Apple Fairytale, but for the money, better streams of whiskey are available.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
84,Exclusive Regions Single Grain (distilled at North British) 10 year old,50,Single Grain Whisky,55,"The nose has a conspicuous grain quality to it, like a bouquet of flowers in a nail salon. In addition to acetone, there is orange fondant and the smell of new Legos. Soft marshmallow and orange cream dilute to strawberry candy, soft peaches, and pineapple, but it’s all swept aside by a Tabasco jackhammer that ricochets between the tongue and palate. Finish of Gatorade fruit punch and ginger root. (246 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
84,Jamie Stewart,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,16,"With whiskies aged for 5 years in bourbon barrels, this has a pleasant nose of dark toffee, vanilla, toasted whole grain bread, and light spices. The mouthfeel is a bit flabby; chocolate and toasted spices, especially cinnamon and pepper, are quelled by malty caramel, baked orange, and touches of old leather. The finish is dry, malty, and slightly nutty, with a hollow core of spices. A bit dour overall.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
84,Ensign Red,40,Canadian,20,"A slightly closed nose opens to pleasing meatiness, then green fruits with hints of evergreen. The palate is sweet and surprisingly rich, although fairly simple. Strong peppery spices and something pleasantly vegetal creep in. Slowly, the sweetness becomes unctuous, turning an otherwise fine sipping whisky into a mixer. Brisk spices provide a counterpoint to the sweetness, but the balance seems off. Some structure finally develops around suggestions of dark chocolate.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2017
85,Dry Fly Straight Wheat,45,Wheat Whiskey,40,"A fragrant nose offers scents of orange blossom, cinnamon, lemon peel, vanilla, and balanced oak. The palate has a drier orange peel note, as well as peanut shells, cinnamon, ginger, and bitter chocolate. Quite dry on the back palate, where the wood influence becomes much more prominent. The finish is light, with bitter chocolate, some nuttiness, tobacco, dried herbs, and drying oak. Pleasant spiciness, cinnamon, and citrus overall.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
85,Balcones Baby Blue Corn (Batch 19-1),46,American Whiskey (Unspecified),40,"A polarizing nose of tropical fruit (papaya, mango, melon) drenched in butterscotch vies with the distinct aroma of tennis shoes on asphalt. The palate is hot, dry, and somewhat ashy, with billowing smoke, tobacco leaf, and nuttiness, undercut by lime and orange oil. Drying and oak-driven on the finish, it’s sweetened by the addition of water.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
85,Spirit Hound Colorado Honey Malt (Barrel No. 4),45,Straight Malt,65,"Straight malt whiskey finished in barrels that previously held honey. The nose is enchanting, perfumy with fresh flowers, bubble gum, cinnamon-dusted apple slices, pink peppercorn, sassafras, and salt water taffy. The honey-barrel finish shows itself on the palate, which has milk chocolate, sugary chai, lemon, molasses, pralines, and, of course, unctuous honey. So syrupy and sweet, it truly gives new meaning to “dessert whiskey.”",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
85,Chambers Bay Straight Bourbon (Batch 6),47.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,43,"Lots to unpack on the nose: dried orange peel, blueberry, maple syrup, herbs, and fragrant spices—cinnamon, allspice, clove, caraway; with water, green papaya and cedar. The palate is dry and chewy with oak, orange, cinnamon, clove, cedar oil, roasted nuts, chocolate, and crushed red pepper. It finishes simply, with dry oak, nutty chocolate, and cinnamon.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
85,Strathcolm 8 year old,40,Single Grain Whisky,36,"Spicy from the start, this has aromas of earthy whole spices, rolled marzipan, new books, and bakery shelves. Before it lays down the spices, it shows its hand with sweet vanilla, cereal notes, flapjacks, and almond paste on the palate. The finish has toasted oats, golden syrup, and spiciness. Decent whisky, though the sweetness is pegged back, and the other Strathcolm grains show greater personality. (3,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
85,Blaum Bros. Straight Bourbon,50,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"The nose has fruity hard candy, citrus oil, and lime Popsicle stick, along with expressive grain. On the palate, the sturdy proof holds up well to a few drops of water, revealing iced herbal tea, mint leaves, cinnamon, black pepper, and orange oil, as well as plenty of chewy oak. The finish is where this whiskey’s personality really starts to show, offering rich dark chocolate and roasted almonds.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
85,Penelope Four Grain Straight Bourbon,40,Bourbon/Tennessee,38,"Notes of red fruit, blueberry, dried cherries, Grape Nuts, lemon oil, and an herbal spiciness on the nose, balanced against an influence of drying oak. The palate is smooth and light, with cinnamon, milk chocolate, peanut shells, green pepper, and oak tannins. The finish is sweet and offers a tropical note of sweet orange and lemon. This whiskey is light, but the four-grain mashbill creates an intriguing non-traditional profile.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
85,Tom’s Town Double Oaked Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"A nose of dark fruit, figs, sassafras, powdered orange candy, and brown sugar leads to a palate that’s lightly nimble, with vanilla, iced tea, lemon, cracked pepper, and textured oak. Water brings out sweeter notes, with orange and strawberry balanced against herbal flavors and eucalyptus. The finish is sweet and a bit light, tasting of sliced orange, vanilla syrup, toasted oak, and roasted herbs. A balanced, light, and somewhat non-traditional bourbon.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
85,Town Branch Kentucky Straight Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,39,"Uncommonly delicate and floral: a bundle of honeysuckle and grandma’s potpourri on the nose, mingled with cantaloupe, almond milk, rice pudding, peach, and Nilla Wafer. It fills the mouth with an oily texture and flavors of tropical fruit, peach, melon, hazelnut, and citrus soap, finishing with lingering tobacco and nuts. Town Branch uses the same proprietary yeast for this bourbon as its Pearse Irish whiskey, which may explain the unusual flavor profile.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
85,Glenrothes 10 year old,40,Single Malt Scotch,45,"Quite youthful on the nose, with barley, vanilla, and finally nectarines. Smooth and medium-bodied, with floral notes, custard, and milk chocolate. A relatively short finish, with sappy oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
85,Balcones Texas Pot Still Straight (Batch 19-1),46,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Oily, earthy, and a bit vegetal on the nose, with nori, moss, caramel corn, toasted pecans, barbecue potato chips, and butterscotch haystacks. The oily-textured palate is heavy on smoky char, roasted corn and nuts, savory mesquite-cooked meat, and spearmint. On the finish, it’s all cigar wrapper, dark chocolate, mint oil, and coffee bean, with plenty of lingering char flavor.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
85,Filibuster Dual Cask Finished Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,41,"Faintly herbal but mostly sweet aromas: Swedish fish, Twizzlers, treacle, marshmallow, and toasted almonds, as well as Lipton tea bag and pine needles. The flavor is dominated by oak, along with charred corn, black pepper, roasted nuts, and pipe tobacco, while the finish takes a slight turn with lingering pine and cigar notes.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
85,Grant’s Cask Editions Ale Cask Finish,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,20,"Buttercream, fresh-cut bread, taffy candy, citrus, and a distinctive hoppy note from the craft ale casks. Charmingly smooth but quite light bodied, there is warmed bramble fruit, bitter grapefruit peel, and plenty of peppery spice. This stands up well to other ale-cask finished whiskies, but in the Grant’s range there are better whiskies with more to offer.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
85,Clan MacGregor,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,10,"Banana chips, peppercorn, coriander stalks, dry grasses, cracker bread, faint lemon zest, butterscotch, and green apple; more grain than malt character evident. With watery citrus, butterscotch, walnut, lemon peel, and caramel initially, it’s lighter-bodied but balanced. It develops more spices and a fine texture as it dilutes, lifted by cinnamon, caramel, and gentle spices. Overlook the hard-to-love nose, and this is tasty both neat and over ice.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
85,Crooked Water Regatta Rum Finish Rye,47.5,Rye Whiskey,50,"Three and half year old rye finished in rum casks from Barbados. Rum-influenced notes of ripe mango, guava, and orange curaçao dominate the nose. A light, nimble mouthfeel with rum sweetness on the palate, plus candied mandarin, lemon, pineapple, and a light pine note. Similar notes on the finish, helped by a sprinkling of white pepper. Flavorful and rich, with the overlay of rum sweetness dominating the rye notes to some degree.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
85,Black Feather Bourbon,43,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"The nose begins with a whiff of new wood, but moves to orange peel, apricot, green banana, raisin bread, black tea, and raspberry Popsicle. The palate is youthful and syrupy in texture, with notes of milk chocolate, burnt almond, vanilla frosting, and chili spice. The finish is barrel-influenced but light and honeyed, with notes of milk chocolate, nuttiness, and spice.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
85,Horse Soldier Barrel Strength,55.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"This bourbon is named for the Special Forces horsemen, known as the horse soldiers, who served in Afghanistan. The nose starts earthy and herbal, with notes of leather, licorice, and light smokiness. Drying oak on the palate, with bitter orange and herbal notes, roasted walnuts, and burnt cinnamon and brown sugar. A finish of orange, bitter chocolate, and espresso beans. Water coaxes out raspberry and honey blossom.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
85,District Made Straight Rye,47,Rye Whiskey,45,"Orange and flower aromas mingled with cinnamon candy, tea leaves, and fresh-cut wood show off the lively side of the grain from the start. In the mouth, this whiskey is spicy and vibrant, with chili pepper, Hot Tamales, green banana, and plenty of oak, finishing on dark chocolate, black tea, and lingering heat. A young whiskey, but well on its way.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
85,Gun Fighter Double Cask Rye,50,Rye Whiskey,34,"Orange, mango, strawberry candy, and licorice on the nose, while water brings out watermelon, more mango, and a soft wood note. A light palate offers fruitcake, orange, blackberry, chocolate, almond, gingersnaps, tobacco, and cedar spice. A finish of vanilla, orange, and more tobacco, with water bringing out hot chocolate, orange, burnt espresso beans, and drying oak. Orangey and tropical at the outset, but also deep and nutty, particularly on the finish.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
85,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection American Oak,42.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,130,"The nose is a bit hot and generally restrained, with dried leaves, earthiness, and waxy crayons. Light-bodied, very soft, and somewhat juicy. Stone fruit and grain flavors combine for an enjoyable peach-pie quality before the tannic finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
85,Charbay Doubled & Twisted,45,American Whiskey (Unspecified),50,"A blend of 3 year old single malt (30%), 3 year old whiskey distilled from pilsner beer (20%), and 7 year old whiskey distilled from stout (30%). Unsurprisingly, the nose is hoppy, with an overlay of pine bough and a tropical fragrance of lemon and pineapple. The palate is deeper, with more hops and pine, plus bitter citrus, lime, and white pepper. The finish melds bitter chocolate, roasted pecans, and toasty oak. (3,960 bottles)",David Fleming,Spring 2019
85,Gentleman Jack,40,Bourbon/Tennessee,32,"A host of sweet confections—caramel corn, candied apples, toasted marshmallow, bubble gum, and gobs of banana taffy—are reminiscent of a warm summer night at the fair. The palate speaks of orchard fruits, sweet golden apples, and poached pear, as hints of peach and cocoa appear on the clean, enjoyable, and succinct finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
85,St. George Spirits Breaking & Entering,43,American Whiskey (Unspecified),40,"American whiskey takes an unusual direction with this blend of straight bourbons from Kentucky and Tennessee, straight rye from Tennessee, and malt whiskey made by St. George Spirits. On the nose, stewed plums and apricots, orange gumdrops, almonds, earthy grain—spilled wine in the garden. A resinous and hoppy palate, with poached pears, cooked ginger, lemon, white pepper, and milk chocolate-covered almonds. Lemon pith and mild oak on the finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
85,Navazos Palazzi Malt Bota Punta,52.5,Spanish Whisky,104,"Red apple, dried fig, clove, baked ham, and plums boiled in sugar in this warm, fragrant, and aromatic whisky made with Spanish malt. The complexity of the nose is not sustained, as the spice characters dominate the palate after the initial few seconds. Baked orange, verging on tropical fruits, is overthrown by the black pepper and clove welling up from the underside of the tongue, leaving a bitter chicory aftertaste. (900 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
85,Sierra Norte Single Barrel Purple Corn,45,World Whisky,50,"Pepper and allspice light up with savory brisket notes, star anise, a dry nuttiness, and a pile of peanut shells. The flavor slowly comes into focus with stewed apple, red currant, pomegranate, and cranberry, background spices, and late caramel sweetness. The finish has throbbing, gum-tingling heavy clove notes with toffee penny chews and red licorice.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
85,A.P. Hotaling J.H. Cutter,48,American Blended Whiskey,50,"Expressively aromatic, with orange, chai spices, incense, spearmint, and Juicy Fruit gum, buttressed by earthy moss and cedar. Equally vivid flavors of dry oak, pepper, cinnamon Red Hots, dried orange peel, orange pekoe tea, and chili-chocolate, but it loses steam on the finish. Water tames some of the brasher qualities without dampening the liveliness.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
85,Blackened,45,American Blended Whiskey,43,"A collaboration between the late Dave Pickerell and metal group Metallica, this sourced straight whiskey blend was finished in so-called “black brandy barrels” for several weeks to the sound of Metallica’s music—a method aimed at enhancing the aging process. Dusty oak, potpourri, leather, licorice, vanilla, and caramel, along with banana, raisins, and plums on the palate. Bitter chocolate and spicy heat punctuate the finish, with a light citrus note.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
85,Proper No. Twelve,40,Irish Blended Whiskey,30,"Initially, Conor McGregor’s whiskey seems more laborious than notorious, with a rather unremarkable nose of fondant orange and mediocre spices, not helped by the first sip’s wishy-washy fruitiness of diluted orange and fudge, but before you tap out, it gets back on its feet and starts swinging for the fences with a redeeming comeback of gingerbread, clove, pepper, charred oak, and a knockout, gum-tingling buzz of spice.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
85,Jim Beam Repeal Batch,43,Bourbon/Tennessee,18,"A delicate nose of golden raisin, Cracker Jack peanuts, pleasing citrus, and hints of clove. The palate is fairly straightforward in its honeyed sweetness and warm cereal notes, with hints of tobacco leaf. Not exciting, but enjoyable in an understated way and a nice leisurely sipper.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
85,Two Stars Kentucky Straight Bourbon,43,Bourbon/Tennessee,26,"Sweet and fruity to start, with Swedish fish, orange Creamsicle, circus peanuts, and some dusty spices: pepper, caraway, and allspice. There’s zippier spice and citrus on the palate, along with chili-chocolate, peanut brittle, cherry cough syrup, and a little leathery oak on the finish. It’s soft and light-bodied—serviceable, but not exciting. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Highland Queen Majesty 15 year old,46,Single Malt Scotch,50,"Sulfury funk on the nose might intimidate, but it’s a harbinger of the whisky’s strong sherry influence. There are also aromas of cinnamon, allspice, tangy stewed fruit, roasted almonds, and saline. The palate is intensely floral, with raisins, dried figs, hazelnuts, red berries, and a little milk chocolate. Richly flavored, but light-bodied; a gentle sherried whisky. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Wyoming Whiskey Steamboat Straight Bourbon,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Aromas of dry cedar, used sandpaper, and hay mingle with candied fruit—green apple Jolly Rancher, Asian pear—along with earthy tea leaves. The wood-forward palate highlights more tea leaves, dried apple rings, apple skins, gentle clove spice, and cedar. It finishes with dry wood, cloves, and a hint of dried orange peel. A peculiar whiskey that seems unsure of itself.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Cadée Deceptivus Bourbon,42.5,Craft Whiskey,50,"Soft oak, brown sugar, and a back note of iron start things off, followed by hints of corn muffin, red candy, and a subtle note of dried red fruit. The palate leads with vanilla rice pudding, a light note of orange peel, milk chocolate, and green apple. It’s creamy, light, and sweet, with baking spice enlivening the chocolate. The finish is lengthy, ending with vanilla icing and a buttery note.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
85,Grangestone Sherry Cask Finish Highland,40,Single Malt Scotch,29,"A delicate grassy nose with aromas of bread dough, green bananas, cardamom, and lemon. Light-bodied on the palate, with pleasant flavors of cardamom, lemon, and white pepper, it rushes through to a more substantial finish of roasted walnuts, tobacco leaf, unsweetened chocolate, and oak. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Pig’s Nose,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,29,"Stick your snout into aromas of rich tea biscuits, honey, tangerine, toasted almond chips, candied pineapple chunks, and a prickle of spice. It’s youthful but integrated, the grain domineering over the malt. A likable flavor sequence begins with lovely honey sweetness, honeydew melon, and pear, before a citrus phase, followed by an ominous wave of spice which vanquishes the sweet fruits, leaving a swift, spicy finish. (12,000 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
85,The Street Pumas’,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,35/liter,"Behind its comic book label, this pallid 3 year old, 40% malt content whisky has a nose of vanilla frosting, fudge, caramel, whole lime, orange peel, fresh apple, nougat, sesame seed bars, and faint notes of ground black pepper This works beautifully in long drinks, with its light character of dominant lemon flavors, vanilla, fizzy sherbet, and traces of spice. No messing around: it’s sharp, tangy, zingy, and refreshing. (12,000 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
85,Clontarf 1014 Classic Blend,40,Irish Blended Whiskey,22,"Named after the Irish victory over the Vikings at the Battle of Clontarf in 1014, this has a nose of vanilla, dusty spices, old sweet-shop toffee, dried banana, and polished wood furniture. While the tasty palate comprises fresh green apple, pear, citrus fruits, vanilla, boiled candies, and an appealing lift of spice, this would be tastier still with a bit more weight behind it.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
85,Trader Joe’s Bourbon Cask Finish Highland,40,Single Malt Scotch,20,"On the nose, spiced plums, cinnamon, clove, ginger, and cooked fruit mingle with seawater and a waft of guava. A tug of war between sweet—orange oil, cookies with lemon icing—and spice—cloves, dried ginger—resolves into a finish of milk chocolate with a hint of hookah tobacco. This is light and a bit hot, but its perfumy character shows well. Finished in first-fill bourbon barrels. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Ainsley Brae Oak Cask Matured Highland,40,Single Malt Scotch,28,"The scents of a forest floor—dried leaves, old pine needles, twigs—mingle with stewed fruit, biscuity malt, lemon oil, and rose petal soap. The palate is light and candy-sweet, like strawberry jelly beans, candied rose petals, and sugar cookies tinged with cinnamon. Youthful and very light, but pleasant. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Ainsley Brae Sherry Cask Finished Highland,40,Single Malt Scotch,30,"An initial aroma of carrot peelings gives way to cedar, allspice, lemon, and chamomile; with water added, carrot cake, almond shell, and lemon icing emerge. On the palate there’s chamomile tea with lemon and clove, candied violet, orange, and cedar, swooping into a finish of oak and dried flowers. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Douhans,40,Blended Irish Whiskey,18,"Coconut cream, orange peel, vanilla, and plenty of sweet grain permeate the nose and carry through to the palate, which is uncomplicated and youthful; a creamy, floral, banana confection touched with lemon. Light and simple—if you like this style of whiskey, this is a good option. (<em>Walmart</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,Wolfhound,40,Blended Irish Whiskey,19,"Ripe orchard fruits, white flowers, saltines, green apple candy, and a hint of floor polish on the nose, along with pie crust that expresses itself as a sweet nuttiness on the palate. The flavors are simple—caramel, roasted hazelnuts, milk chocolate, and orange—and the finish short. If you’re after an ordinary Irish blend, this should do the trick. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
85,WhistlePig Farmstock Rye Crop 002,43,Craft Whiskey,73,"Whistle Pig raised the share of its own 2 year old rye from 20 percent to 32 percent in this second Farmstock release, balancing it against 6 and 10 year old sourced ryes, like in the 001 release. Fresh oak mixes with vanilla, orange peel, and pepper on the nose, leading to a palate of vanilla and butterscotch. Citrus emerges with water. Pepper notes return on the finish, along with chocolate and caramel. There’s youthfulness here, but also potential.",David Fleming,Fall 2018
85,Kings County Peated Bourbon,45,Craft Whiskey,40/375ml.,"On the nose, the peat presents itself as an autumn bonfire, with dried logs and dried leaves mingling with gentle spices of white pepper, dried ginger, and a bit of salinity. The wood keeps burning through the palate, which is fairly hot and replete with classic bourbon flavors of vanilla, caramel, roasted nuts, and apples. Pleasant enough, but ultimately a simple whiskey.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
85,Pennington Distilling Co. Davidson Reserve Rye,50,Craft Whiskey,60,"Though it takes some easing into, this whiskey shows pretty clove and vanilla notes on the nose, along with some Elmer’s glue and grape Kool-Aid. The palate is where the rye grain starts to shine, with spice, peaches, plums, and milk and white chocolate, and cooked cherries on the finish. Water is a must to cut through the youthful heat.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
85,Grant’s Elementary Carbon 6 year old,40,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,30,"The black-labeled Carbon relates to heavily charred casks, which bring aromas of toffee, raisin, chocolate, dark concentrated fruits, barbecued meat, and ashy soot. The smokiness broods malevolently if you leave the glass. The texture feels too light to shoulder the flavors of dark char, toffee, spice, and dark fruity chocolate as the balance becomes swamped in smoke. It’s like a young child wearing their father’s thickest winter overcoat. (<em>Global Travel Retail only</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
85,Baltimore Spirits Co. Epoch Rye (Batch 1),50,Craft Whiskey,40,"This is one for the oak fanatics. Wood and grain assert themselves right from the start, but the nose retains balance with aromas of butterscotch, fresh ginger, and herbs. The oak-forward palate shows pleasant flavors of cherry cough drop, dark chocolate, blackberries, red licorice, star anise, and ginger. Oak continues on the finish, which has nice length. Don’t be shy about adding water.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
85,Glen Moray Elgin Classic Port Cask Finish,40,Single Malt Scotch,30,"This is finished for 8 months in tawny port pipes and is quite restrained on the early nose, opening up to reveal rose petals, milk chocolate, and double cream.  The palate is floral, with raisins  and red currants. Drying in the  finish, with peppery oak and  cinnamon.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
85,Pearse Distiller’s Choice,42,Irish Blended Whiskey,50,"A stronger grain distillate characterizes this malt and grain blend aged for under a decade. More forthright than the Original, with mint leaves, fresh orange, dry spices, lemon peel, and the bouquet of aromatic florist’s grasses. Enticing soft fruits are subdued by the grain flavors of spicy green herbal notes and astringent clove, although it mellows to a redeeming finish of sherry trifle and bubble gum. (KY, GA, and FL, with expansion planned)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
85,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Millstone) 6 year old,48.9,Dutch,75,"Originating from Zuidam Distillers’ diverse inventory of casks, this single malt whisky conjures thoughts of bread dough, white grape, and slightly sour spices. The orange flavors start as a deep glow, then blossom beautifully into rich marmalade aromas. Initially mouth-drawing, with bold, juicy flavors of peach and orange supported by toffee and a gentle lift of spices. Appetizing taste of spiced orange cake to finish. (637 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
85,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Slyrs) 3 year old,52.5,World Whisky,90,"White pepper-dappled summer fruits on the nose, with squishy overripe melon, banana peel, zesty lime, dried grasses, and clove, with a slightly rubberized note like BMX handlebar grips. This young Bavarian single malt has a rich, syrupy texture and tastes of sour fruits, bitter orange peel, and barley, shifting to creamy caramel and peppery spices. Finish of caramel, peppercorn, and peach pit. Not bad at all. (691 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
85,J&B Rare,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,23,"Justerini &amp; Brooks sold scotch in the U.S. before Prohibition. This light, Speyside-style blend has grassy notes, with crystalized lemon slices, Bramley apple peel, woodsmoke, and almonds. Light and sweet on the tongue, it unpacks lemon peel, satsuma, juicy watermelon, pepper, and aniseed. Grain whisky and herbal notes creep in late and permeate the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
85,Davidson Reserve Four Grain Tennessee Straight Whiskey (Batch 1),50,Craft Whiskey,45,"This whiskey shows some green-spirit youth, but it’s headed in a good direction, with sassafras, toasted nuts, leather, forest aromas, and a touch of furniture polish. It’s much bigger on the palate, as burnt peanut candies meet baking spices, and treacle. The wood jumps out a bit and the fiery youth is undeniable, but plenty to like. (2,580 bottles)",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
85,J. Henry & Sons 5 year old Wisconsin Straight Bourbon (Batch 34),46,Craft Whiskey,50,"The nose offers a nice mélange of herbal and fruit notes, as pine sap, earthy forest floor, and menthol balance with sweet Bananas Foster and baked apple.

85,New Deal Distiller’s Reserve Oregon Straight Bourbon,40,Craft Whiskey,40,"Makes a pleasant first impression as sweet apple and corn notes meet summer flowers, Cracker Jack, and fresh oak.

The nutty finish shows toasted almonds and caramel.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
85,Tommyrotter Triple Barrel American Whiskey,46,Craft Whiskey,40,"Aromas of menthol, licorice, and herbs have a slightly antiseptic quality, yet the caramelized oak and grilled pineapple flavors keep it grounded in bourbon. Bold and intriguing on the palate, it pours a bit hot, with lots of cedar shingle and sandalwood balanced by banana and toasted marshmallow. Cinnamon and candied orange on the finish. A blend of Indiana bourbons and Tennessee whiskeys finished in red wine casks.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
85,Ballyhoo,43,Irish,30,"Fresh and grassy, it’s quite dainty, with peach, Liquorice Allsorts, and light florals. Sugary sweetness, lemon slices, and candied orange jellies, concluding with hot white pepper and residual sweetness. This is sourced 4 year old grain whiskey finished in port barrels, though the label does not disclose this. Otherwise, an original, delectable finishing concept.

85,Dewar’s 18 year old The Vintage,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,80,"Vanilla laced with spice, fondant icing, grapefruit peel, and lime zest leave the vanilla and floral notes lower down the pecking order. In the mouth, grapefruit and orange dominate the vanilla, yet the mouthfeel is thinner and the acidity tips toward the taste of bitter orange seeds. A lingering bitter orange finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
85, Dewar’s White Label,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,25,"Honey, fudge, a little melon and white grape, dry roasted spices, and peppercorn, but noticeably less fruit than the age-statement varieties. The palate has pulpy white melon, lemon, lime, and some grapefruit acidity, before sweetening with honey. Quite tart at times, some peppery spice collaborates before the vanilla cream and green fruits take charge. A clean, juicy finish of lemon zest and mild spices coats the throat.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
85,FEW Italia,46.5,Craft Whiskey,50,"Super floral with bright lemon and yuzu, this beams with originality, as violet candies, rose petal, and pine forest join the fray.

85,Coppersea Bonticou Crag Straight Malt Rye,48,Rye Whiskey,80,"A very grain-forward nose, reminiscent of caraway or a fresh pumpernickel loaf. A soft, dusty rye, with hints of peppermint, spearmint, and cinnamon candy and bitter brown sugar. Quite dry, with some bitter oak, dry hay, and fresh-sawn lumber. Dried herbs, grilled pineapple, and lingering pepper on the finish. Made from rye malted by hand and distilled in direct-fired stills, this whiskey is more focused on grain than oak. <em><a href=""/best-empire-rye-new-york/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empire rye</a></em>",Adam Polonski,Spring 2018
85,New York Distilling Co. Ragtime Rye Applejack Finish,50,Rye Whiskey,46,"A true fruit bouquet on the nose, with apple, lemon, peach, and apricots, balanced by gentle wood. Very buttery and creamy on the palate, with a panoply of earthy white chocolate, pretty baking spice, and minced apple. A little too much fresh lumber and banana flavor, but well-balanced and intriguing. The applejack cask finish is a nice touch, but the rye could still use more time in the barrel. <em><a href=""/best-empire-rye-new-york/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empire rye</a></em>",Adam Polonski,Spring 2018
85,Whiskey Del Bac Classic Unsmoked,42,Craft Whiskey,49,"Driven by earthy oak and dark cocoa on the nose, this whiskey is alluring in its rustic richness, with saddle leather and a pocketful of dried fruit pulled from an old backpack. On the palate, the cherry and red berry fruit meet some pleasant peppery and clove spice, with the impression of lemon oil. Pleasingly drinkable, with caramel and more oak on the modest finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
85,Kurayoshi 3 year old,46,Japanese,65,"Aged for just 3 years, the nose is a fresh fruit salad of green apple, honeydew, lychee, and kumquat. The green fruits and tangy citrus on the palate fall under attack from peppery arugula leaves and active spices. A structure as light as cotton candy; the flavor of orange taffy is all that remains when the dust settles. The finish is dry and peppery, with a slight herbal note. (1,440 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
85,Lost Spirits Abomination The Crying of the Puma,54,Miscellaneous,50,"An aggressive punch of peat—creosote, tar, rubber, and seaweed—mingles with wood spice, butterscotch, vanilla pudding, and red apple on the nose. The palate shows charred meat, charred wood, earthy smoke, crème brûlée, and red apple flavors. The short, ashy finish satisfies with dark chocolate and black pepper. At such a high proof, it takes water well and develops in the glass.

Actual Time in Barrel: 18 months;

Processing: Multiple peated malt distillates are aged in Scotland, then blended, exported, and put through Lost Spirits’ reactor with pieces of toasted oak treated with Riesling wine.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2018
85,Thomas H. Handy Sazerac Straight Rye (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2017),63.6,Rye Whiskey,90,"Initially, an unwanted mustiness is present, but it quickly turns into a damp cellar note, followed by dill, eucalyptus, fresh oak, and mint. Hints of smoke emerge over pecan shell and chewing tobacco. Then a cherry cough syrup note appears, with baking spices gaining steam, but the whiskey never truly finds a desired dominant note or balance. The finish gives it hope: it lingers with a hint of brown sugar.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
85,Woody Creek Straight Rye,45,Craft Whiskey,45,"An enjoyable 2 year old from Colorado, the sweet stone fruit nose, laced with mint and herb garden, betrays this spirit as a bit young and primary. Still a touch hot and lacking some intensity, but pleasing clover honey sweetness on the palate and long, warming spice with a cocoa finish bode very well for the future.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
85,Fukano 12 year old Single Cask No. 273,42.3,Japanese,100,"Aromas of grapefruit, orange peel, and burnt sugar crackling atop crème brûlée, with ground almond and tarragon. The texture is mouth drawing and astringent, like it’s warping the dimensions of your mouth for its own ends. Dark chocolate and bitter plum transition into cocoa powder and plum pudding with traces of oak. Persistent heat, with herbal notes and chili spice on the finish. Leave the water aside. (456 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
86,Compass Box The Circle (2019 Release),46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,150,"Rosey Mitchell, of Three Sheets cocktail bar in London and winner of the Compass Box bartender competition, collaborated on this whisky with Compass Box whisky maker Jill Boyd. Apple strudel, well-toasted malted bread, red apple, and hints of peat smoke: this pushes in lots of different directions. Light fudge, a well of active spices, orange, and peppercorn with smoked citrus peel on the dry finish. Convoluted and discombobulating. (6,151 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
86,Leopold Bros. Small Batch American Whiskey (Barrel No. 1206),43,American Whiskey (Unspecified),33,"The nose is plucky and herbaceous, with tarragon, dill, licorice, and heaps of chili powder and cornmeal—a bit like elote from a street vendor. Savory flavors dominate the palate, which is dry and nutty; water brings out meaty chili, unsweetened chocolate, and coffee bean. The finish has grilled corn, more chili spices, and roasted pecans. Water softens the edges, but use a light touch so as not to over dilute.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
86,Chicken Cock Beer Barrel Select,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"Dried orange and apricot, cherry hard candy, and vanilla frosting on the nose, along with cantaloupe, peanut butter, and grainy notes of seed corn. The palate is light, spiced, and oak-driven, with more corn, peanuts, chocolate sauce, and orange oil, plus vanilla, iced tea, citrus oil, lemon, spice, and chili pepper. The finish offers more heft, but is light, though with some interesting elements on offer.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
86,Westland Black Raven Brewing Co. American Single Malt,50,Single Malt American Whiskey,100,"Herbal and peppery on the nose, offering dill, licorice, guava, and green banana, as well as a hint of mint and black cherry cough medicine. The mouthfeel is somewhat tart, with burnt espresso beans, bitter chocolate, and a note of toasted almond. A long finish of caramel and bitter chocolate, as well as charred, bitter hoppy notes melds with a sweet, honeyed and syrupy taste and texture. A fascinating flavor progression.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
86,Barr An Uisce Wicklow Hills,40,Blended Irish Whiskey,35,"Lemon drizzle cake and finely shredded orange peel on this Barr An Uisce first-fill bourbon cask-matured blend of 21% malt whiskey and 79% grain that has enjoyed a 3-month oloroso sherry finish. With light lemon, green melon, and flashes of citrus, it revs up the toffee and marzipan notes, ending with a pleasing, sweet swan song of caramel and white chocolate. A gentle dram for quiet times.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
86,Davidson Reserve Small Batch Tennessee Straight Sour Mash,50,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"A pleasant nose of spicy, perfumed oak that’s also lightly floral and melds well with notes of coriander and dill, pistachio pudding, and hints of earthiness and minerality. The palate has plenty of spice and heat, with youthful notes of papaya, cinnamon, salt water taffy, bitter chocolate, and young oak. Water unlocks more pronounced cinnamon and a light nuttiness, improving upon a somewhat youthful finish.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
86,Omar Bourbon Cask Single Malt,46,Taiwanese Whisky,80,"Dried banana, curry powder, chopped cilantro, and creamed coconut on the nose, but there’s a note of oak astringency and a scent of menthol toothpaste as well. With crème caramel, banana, dried apricot, and candy sweetness, the whisky has a good weight in the mouth, and builds to flavors of tangerine, with perky peppery spices under the tongue. Lengthy finish of banana taffy and a shower of spice.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
86,Strathcolm The Extra Special,40,Single Grain Scotch,30,"This opens promisingly with creamy, buttery aromas of vanilla frosting, toasted crumpets, and dry spices, and delivers on that promise in flavor. A charming silky texture with vanilla sweetness, hints of lemon, spice, and flavors of baked goods arriving in time for the finish of toasted spice. One to splash over ice and sip in the great outdoors. (6,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
86,Broken Top Bourbon,43.7,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"Made at Oregon’s Cascade Street Distillery and purporting to be “mountain-style” bourbon, this whiskey presents a mix of herbal and fruity aromas to start, along with baking spice, brown sugar, and vanilla frosting. The palate is light-bodied but rich in oak, roasted nut, dried chili, cocoa powder, and cigar, with dried flower notes when water is added; plenty of oak and dark chocolate on the finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
86,Jeptha Creed Four Grain Straight Bourbon,49,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"The nose is dry and chalky, with notes of dried leaves, dried cherries, and raspberries. The palate is also dry, with some peppery spice. Water unlocks chocolate, and the dryness recedes a bit. The finish is the best part, offering orange Creamsicle and vanilla notes, though still dry. Water brings out light tobacco leaf. Unusually dry and somewhat ashy, with some appealing notes that never quite emerge.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
86,Founding Farmers Rye (Batch 14),50,Rye Whiskey,45,"This rye was divisive among Whisky Advocate’s blind tasting panel due to its unusual smokiness, the result of using smoked barley in the mash. On the nose, it presents as mesquite, cooked sausage, tilled earth, Lapsang Souchong, and dry leaves, along with saline and nuts. The palate is full, dry, and savory, with peppered smoked meat, cinnamon, chocolate, nuts, and big oak flavor. A short dry finish, with cigar notes, but little ash. Distilled at Copper Fox Distillery and blended by Founding Spirits Distillery.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
86,Last Straw Straight Ontario Rye,43,Canadian,57,"Last Straw’s inaugural whisky is a humdinger of a 100% rye, with oodles of oomph and a pleasing balance of grain and barrel notes. Youthfully malty, it shows rye spices, dry hay, barrel tones, hot black licorice, some citrus notes, and candied fruit. Hints of butterscotch and vanilla temper black pepper and sweet pine pitch. Lots of nuances for a 3 year old. The flavor sings at bottle strength. $75 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2019
86,Old Potrero Single Malt Straight Rye,48.5,Rye Whiskey,70,"Made with 100% malted rye. A nose of candied orange, cherry, green banana, and melon, along with sultanas, prunes, berries, and nuts. The palate starts orangey and sweet, followed by licorice, espresso, bitter chocolate, cashew, molasses, burnt sugar, and spice. Water unveils roasted peanuts, marshmallow char, more chocolate, and coffee beans. The finish is balanced oak, charred almonds, more coffee beans, tropical melon, and orange. Pleasurably crunchy, with intriguing overlays of bitter chocolate, espresso, and nuttiness.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
86,Clan Denny 2008 10 year old (distilled at Craigellachie),46,Single Malt Scotch,59,"This bottling from Douglas Laing was distilled in January 2008, matured in a refill hogshead, and bottled in October 2018. Floral notes on the nose, with barley, vanilla, soft spice, and baked apple. Full-on orchard fruits and more barley on the palate. Soft and sweet. The finish dries, becoming slightly earthy and tannic, with black pepper. (371 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
86,Clan Denny 10 year old (distilled at Fettercairn),46,Single Malt Scotch,59,"Earthy on the early nose, with a brief whiff of boiled cabbage and contrasting hints of violet. Ripe apples and pears on the relatively full palate, with toffee, honey, and a background earthiness. The finish is medium in length, herbal, with ginger and bog oak. (308 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
86,Clan Denny 10 year old (distilled at Bunnahabhain),46,Single Malt Scotch,59,"The nose gives off gentle sea breezes, earthy and nutty aromas, then cocoa powder. Pineapple, toffee, and milk chocolate on the palate, with a suggestion of brine. Nutty in the finish, with white pepper and lingering lemon. (367 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
86,St. George Single Malt (Lot 18),43,Single Malt American Whiskey,100,"Plummy, earthy, and zingy with grapefruit and pine aromas, along with orange marmalade, raspberry, and hazelnut. Light-bodied and silky in the mouth, it has flavors of lemon cake, hazelnut, milk chocolate, and intense floral and fruity hops, as well as sweet plum and mocha notes. This whiskey’s beauty is in its delicate balance, although it may veer too far out of the middle lane for conventional palates.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
86,Belle Meade 9 year old Oloroso Sherry Cask Finished,45.2,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Buttery, nutty, and richly spiced, this has all the hallmarks of a sherry-finished whiskey—dried fruit, hazelnuts, chocolate—but retains its bourbon core with strong peanut, concord grape jelly, and roasted corn aromas. On the palate, it’s bourbon first: peanuts, cooked cherries, and plenty of oak. But the sherry softens and rounds out the mouthfeel, adding gentle spice, dried fruit, and silkiness.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
86,A.D. Laws Four Grain Ruby Porto Cask-Finished,47.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Aromas of orange, roasted pineapple, lime, pine nuts, cinnamon, and leather on the nose, with a cherry-strawberry note. Light, refined cherry on the palate, with roasted walnuts, dark chocolate, and light char. Water unlocks bright cherry and chocolate fudge, with notes of char and roasted coffee beans. A nutty, fruity finish carries on the red berry note, along with a swirl of vanilla and chocolate. A deft balance of fruit, sweetness, and spice.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
86, Deadwood Rye,41.5,Rye Whiskey,25,"Named for the town of Deadwood, S.D., where Wild Bill Hickok was gunned down in 1876. A blend of two rye mashbills, 95% rye and 70% rye, aged at least 2 years in American oak. Orange blossom on the nose, herbal notes, pine nuts, anise, and fragrant oak. A honeyed palate offers kiwi, tangerine, and orange, balanced against bitter chocolate and espresso. The finish is sweet, with floral orange notes and chocolate syrup.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
86,Deadwood Straight Bourbon,40.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Vivacious and fresh aromas of raspberry, licorice cookies, brown sugar, herbal tea, and toasted oak. The palate falls a little short of the setup, with a light body and some youthful heat driven by oak. Nevertheless, orange and lemon peels, roasted pecans, caramel, blackberry, nutmeg, and black pepper punch through the wood, demonstrating a well-executed, if simple, bourbon.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
86,Infuse Spirits Broken Barrel (Batch 03),47.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"The nose is sweet and wood-driven, with butterscotch, molasses cookies, toasted pecans, and a faint floral note. Cinnamon, chili pepper, almonds, orange, and candied violets buoy a somewhat thin mouthfeel, all rounded off with sweet floral flavors and subtle oak. Six month old Kentucky bourbon that has been “finished” in stainless steel tanks with French and American oak and oloroso  sherry staves.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
86,Red Saw Straight Bourbon,48,Bourbon/Tennessee,39,"Grain-forward on the nose, with raw peanuts, milk chocolate, orange pekoe tea, grape Pixy Stix, and cinnamon Teddy Grahams. Without water, the palate is chewy, oaky, and grain-heavy; with water, there’s a delicious Cocoa Krispies flavor, as well as walnuts and cinnamon oatmeal. Nutty chocolate and oak on the finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
86,Niagara Falls Rye,40,Canadian,23,"A straightforward 4 year old Canadian blend, great for mixing, but good for sipping too. It presents flavors of toffee, brisk spices, kiwi fruit, charred wood, and sweet barley sugars. A creamy body with pleasingly penetrating pepper that feels minty-warm, like menthol. Not overly complex, but getting there. More pepper and a refreshing, slightly bitter pithiness on a medium finish. A creamy palate soothes the energetic attack of the spices.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2019
86,Cardhu Gold Reserve,40,Single Malt Scotch,40,"Representing House Targaryen, this features its three-headed dragon on the label. Malt and honey on the subtle nose, with a hint of cinnamon. Medium-bodied, with milk chocolate, caramel, and youthful oak. Jaffa orange and gentle spice in the relatively short, spiky finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2019
86,Woodford Reserve Bottled in Bond,50,Bourbon/Tennessee,50/375ml,"Fairly light in flavor, with warm cereal and honey notes laced with aromas of green herbs, chamomile, and spearmint. Seems well-crafted, but the flavors are generally understated, offering gentle sweetness and fleeting glimmers of baking spice. Modest body and a touch hot on the finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
86,McKenzie Straight Bourbon,45.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,43,"Vibrantly fruity with strawberry and orange Creamsicle on the nose, along with clean hay, toasted oak, cinnamon, caramel, and bay leaf. Wood spices on the front palate give way to orange custard, pomegranate, caramel, and cinnamon bread notes, with a pop of chili-dusted roasted corn lashed with bitter oak on the finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
86,Clan Denny (distilled at Port Dundas) 14 year old,46,Single Grain Scotch,55,"Red apple skin, sharp citrus zest, peach stone, and shortcake biscuit greet the nose, though there is abundant grain character, with lemongrass and coriander seeds too. A muscular dram from a closed distillery, this reveals sweet cereals, honey, a spectrum of citrus notes, sherbet sweetness, pepper, clove, and herbal notes. Sweetness remains with the pepper in the finish, though clove reigns supreme when water is added.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
86,Clyde May’s Straight Rye,47,Rye Whiskey,45,"Generous proof and just 3 years of age mean this is no wallflower whiskey. Peppermint, white flowers, leather, and Pine-Sol aromas turn gingery on the palate, revealing bold rye spice, root beer, licorice, cinnamon sticks, and pine boughs. Good intensity, if a touch brash.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
86,Coppersea Bottled in Bond Bonticou Crag Straight Malt Rye,50,Rye Whiskey,125,"A bottled in bond sequel to the 48% ABV Bonticou Crag Straight Malt Rye whiskey, this second Empire rye from Coppersea Distilling is made from 100% Hudson Valley rye. A whiff of new wood yields to complex notes of blood orange, iced tea, cinnamon, cloves, and red candy. A palate of allspice, mint, white pepper, and orange peel is followed by a spicy, herbaceous finish that also offers citrus, chocolate, and a hint of tobacco.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
86,Duncan Taylor Dimensions (distilled at Caledonian) 1987 31 year old,52.9,Single Grain Whisky,300,"Produced the year before the distillery closed, this has lemon butter, popcorn, bouquet garni, garlic shoots, and chopped cilantro ensuring the imbiber knows this is grain, not one masquerading as a single malt. Light green fruits reminiscent of melon, apple, and nectarine on the palate, with caramel, vanilla, a little oak, and a ripple of spice, notably coriander seed and pepper, before a finish of pears in golden syrup.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
86,Calumet Farm Single Rack Black 12 year old,47,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Grainy and floral on the nose, with aromas of bananas Foster, pine resin, cardamom, lemon, iced tea, tart blackberries, and nougat. Kicky black pepper and cinnamon smooth out with a touch of water, yielding banana Popsicle, lemon bars, roasted pistachios, and cigar wrapper. A short finish with toasted oak, pecans, and nougat.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
86,Old Overholt Straight Rye,40,Rye Whiskey,17,"A veteran rye whiskey brand that flaunts the floral quality of younger ryes with its summer flowers, bright citrus, and lemon oil notes. A well-polished palate, with warm porridge, and grain notes that smack of peanut butter on warm toast. Nice character and balance, if a touch anemic at this proof.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
86,Sons of Erin,46,Irish Single Malt,40,"Zested lemon, pine-scented floor cleaner, and quite a grassy proposition with white peach, dried flowers, perfumed soaps, and orange pith. It has a slightly soapy mouthfeel with lavender, lemon curd, vanilla, and clove and pepper, the spices ramping up the intensity the longer it’s held in the mouth. Clove and bitter lemon on the finish: takes you from whimsy to wildness in seconds.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
86,Hellyers Road Original,40,Australian Whisky,70,"Creamy lemon truffles, cereal notes, vanilla sponge, dry oak, with peppered steak seasoning. Creamy, sweet, buttery, soft honeydew melon, peach notes, and orange zest, with a soft late spiciness, though the impression is much more tame than the nose suggests. Buttery, mouth-coating finish with gentle spices on the core whisky from this Tasmanian distillery.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
86,Madoc Single Malt,46.1,World Whisky,63,"Grain takes center stage, showing itself in a restrained, sweet manner: aromas of marzipan, oatmeal cookies, Jordan almonds, crushed peanuts on an ice cream sundae, and caramel. The palate is consistent, offering almond croissant, sugar cookie, vanilla pudding, light caramel, and a creamy mouthfeel, finished off with supple oak, caramel, and almonds. Made in Patagonia, Argentina. <em>2,500 Argentine pesos; Argentina only</em>",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
86,Michter’s US*1 Toasted Barrel Finish Bourbon (2018 Release),45.7,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"The nose on this is lovely and seductive, with a gingerbread cookie quality coupled with leather and baking spices. The palate is lively and warming with root beer spices, but its character is overshadowed by the intensity of the toasted barrel, and feels just a bit hollow beneath all that lavish oak.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
86,Aberlour Casg Annamh (Batch 1),48,Single Malt Scotch,65,"A new small-batch addition to the Aberlour line-up, Casg Annamh (Gaelic for ‘rare cask’) has been matured in European and American oak oloroso sherry casks. Rich, buttery caramel aromas, grilled pineapple, and ginger. The palate is smooth, and yields spicy vanilla, tangerines, and cloves. Lots of black pepper and licorice in the relatively long finish. Less complex than the distillery’s A’bunadh.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
86,Kavalan Distillery Select,43,Taiwanese Whisky,60,"With two distilleries now on-site, the new Kavalan has a nose of apple and cinnamon pie, loaves of bread, new hardback books, flashes of lemon peel, and mild spices that flatter the baked fruits. A lighter structure, with pleasant green apple and pear notes, a tingle of pepper and allspice, becoming creamier with the flavor of sherbet flying-saucer candy. More active spices on the finish amid fading fruits.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
86,Kirkland 12 year old,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,39/1.75 liter,"Floral and creamy on the nose, like meringue perfumed with orange-blossom water. The palate is straightforward: vanilla, bubble gum, rose petal, orange blossom, and crème brûlée, with a short, light finish of toasted almonds and chalky vanilla fudge. (<em>Costco</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
86,Kirkland 4 year old,40,Irish Blended Whiskey,28/1.75 liter,"The first whiff is that of a garden tea party: geraniums, potting soil, and floral and grassy aromas mingle with apple peels, toasted coconut, and vanilla. In the mouth, it’s very light, although the flavors that are present are enjoyable: vanilla cupcake, lemon muffin, toasted almonds, and a hint of coconut. Simplicity that lends itself to easy drinking. (<em>Costco</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
86,Heaven’s Door Straight Rye,46,Rye Whiskey,80,"Violet candies, rose petal, and lots of fresh grainy aromas meet hints of candle wax on the nose. The palate is quite pretty and pure, and delivers good intensity of white pepper spice, citrus, and vanilla cream before a fairly short finish. Does not hold up to water, but there are some nice flavors here.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
86,Driftless Glen Single Barrel Straight Bourbon,48,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Oak-forward from start to finish, with aromas of new wood, fresh and dried flowers, oranges, candy apple, cherry soda, and iced tea. Wood, fresh apple, semi-dark chocolate, orange, iced tea, chamomile, and a sweep of spices roll into a cinnamon, clove, and chocolate finish that remains oak-dominated.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
86,Bellevoye Black,43,French Whisky,55,"A good hit of woodsmoke, some coastal character, black cherry, and ground black pepper, but there is a sulfurous note with a hint of rubber gloves. The perfectly placid palate of citrus and caramel is disrupted by an angry swarm of pepper, which eventually dies away, leaving behind more smoke and hints of hazelnut. A mouth-watering finish of orange candy and pepper.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
86,Glen Fohdry Dublaich Speyside,47.1,Single Malt Scotch,28,"Earthy and a bit saline on the nose, like a pine forest in spitting distance of the sea. The palate shows a bit of youthful heat, as well as grilled fruit, polished oak, walnuts, and a somewhat soapy character. The finish is nutty and chocolaty, with structured oak. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
86,Ainsley Brae Sauternes Cask Finished Highland,40,Single Malt Scotch,30,"A sweet and clean nose, with aromas of confectioners’ sugar, meringue, vanilla, and almond flour. The balanced palate has richer layers of oak, blueberry jam, red berries, candied ginger, and chocolate, leading into a quick but pleasant finish with a hint of spice. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More)</em>",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
86,Granndach 12 year old,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,24,"Sherry cask influence makes itself known through cooked plums, chocolate, dried figs, raisins, hazelnuts, and sugared almonds on the nose. The palate is also sherry-forward and sweet, featuring dried and stewed fruit, hazelnut, almond, dark chocolate, and light gingerbread flavors. There’s a youthful heat, and the finish wraps up with bitter oak and a wisp of chocolate-covered raisin. Despite the low proof, a few drops of water help this hang together more evenly. (<em>Walmart</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
86,Woodford Reserve Straight Malt,45.2,Straight Malt,35,"This malt whiskey shows some maple syrup and honey sweetness, but its character comes from savory notes of earthiness and wet leaves. The easygoing palate offers some stone fruit and sweet overripe banana, like a banana cream pie with graham cracker crust. But the finish circles back to savory and herbal, suggesting youth. A creative, if peculiar choice for Woodford, crafted from 51% malted barley.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
86,The Tyrconnell 10 year old Port Cask Finish,46,Irish Single Malt,75,"Comparatively speaking, the aromas of red apple, peppercorn, baked ham, and rowanberry make it the least enticing nose in the Tyrconnell range, although the port cask endows a beautiful delicate blush to the whiskey’s color. The mouthfeel is thinner too, with red apple, watermelon, mouth-drawing oak, fruit chews, and burnt spices in the end. A redeeming finish, however, the gums tingling delightfully with fruit and spice.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
86,Smooth Ambler Contradiction Bourbon,46,Craft Whiskey,40,"Oak-driven and tightly wound, with herbal licorice, beeswax, and dried peaches. There is a real outdoorsy quality here of forest floor, autumn leaves, and cut grass. But it feels somewhat tired and weary on the palate, then falls apart with the addition of water. Grab the older bottling (50% ABV). This release has dropped in both proof and quality.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
86,Wilderness Trail Single Barrel Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Barrel 14D07),50,Craft Whiskey,52,"It’s all about the grain on the nose: corncob, cooked mash, along with hay and grass, brown sugar, and earthy dried herbs. Chewy tannins overtake more subtle fruit and spice notes in the mouth; add a little water to reveal grape jelly, milk chocolate, and cinnamon candy. An impressive start from this young Kentucky distillery, though the short finish shows it has some developing yet to do. (236 bottles)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
86,J. Riddle Peated Bourbon,45.5,Craft Whiskey,45,"There’s no missing the peat here; the nose is rife with ash, rubber tires, wood-burning fireplace, and cedar bark. But it also reveals lovely aromas of roasted apples, charred corn, black pepper, and roasted walnuts. Sweet corn, apples, honey, and nuts step forward on the palate, which is a bit hot, along with black pepper, cinnamon, dark chocolate, and oak. The finish is enjoyable ashiness—the end of a cigar.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
86,G. Rozelieures Smoky Collection,46,French Whisky,65,"A much darker dram, with smoke from log fires, chocolate, toasted oak, crispy bacon, and dark toffee, but this really drills home the smoke, which dominates over the other characteristics. Toffee, malt, dark cherry, smoking oak, cinnamon, and pepper, but tasting is a rather linear experience. Some redeeming qualities, but it lacks the focus of the rest of the range. Finish of banana loaf and singed fruitcake.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
86,2Bar Straight Bourbon,50,Craft Whiskey,48,"Seattle bourbon made using Northwest grains. Aromas of goldenrod, golden raisins, and spicy stewed prunes; a panoply of alluring spices, chocolate, and oak. The palate carries through with similar notes, along with apricot and dark red fruits, but a dusty edge and an excess of tight, tannic green oak hold it back. Chili-chocolate spice, minerality, and lingering fruit on the finish. Impressive complexity, but somewhat woody and off-balance.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
86,Evan Williams 1783,43,Bourbon/Tennessee,20,"It begins with notes of brown sugar, Nutter Butter, hazelnut, nutmeg, and vanilla, with hints of roasted nuts. They’re pronounced and rounded, with secondary and tertiary notes introducing malt, cornbread, and salt water taffy. The medium finish offers a hint of bacon bits.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
86,Glen Moray Elgin Classic Chardonnay Cask Finish,40,Single Malt Scotch,30,"After 6 to 7 years of maturation in bourbon casks, this spent several months in chardonnay white wine casks. The nose offers resinous wine notes, melon, grapefruit, and a hint of vanilla. Nutty on the palate, with orchard fruits, more vanilla, and milk chocolate. Peaches and a slightly oily note in the finish, with apples, nutmeg, and a sprinkling of black pepper.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
86,Glen Moray Elgin Classic Peated,40,Single Malt Scotch,30,"Highly approachable, with soft, earthy peat on the nose, plus pineapple, honey, and vanilla. Warm leather, ashy peat, ripe pears, and discreet vanilla notes on the palate. Slightly thinner than the unpeated Classic. Relatively long in the finish, with peppery peat and ultimately, aniseed.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
86,Glen Moray Elgin Classic Sherry Cask Finish,40,Single Malt Scotch,30,"After 6 to 7 years in a bourbon cask, this is finished for 9 to 12 months in oloroso casks. Sweet sherry, glacé cherries, butterscotch, and roses on the nose. Medium-bodied, with caramel, dark chocolate-cherry liqueur, and warming spices. The finish yields black currant, cough medicine, then allspice, and slowly drying oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
86,Pearse The Original,42,Irish Blended Whiskey,40,"Ripe yellow fruits, summer florals, satsuma peel, anise candy, and, unexpectedly, a catch of smoke at the back of the throat. Interestingly, the malt in this blend was made elsewhere, on the stills now installed at the Pearse Lyons Distillery in Dublin. Mellow, with tropical fruits, melon, and citrus. It becomes quite tangy, with a growing dominance of spices, ginger, and pepper. Shades of sourness creep in, heralding a light, spicy finish. (KY, GA, and FL, with expansion planned)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
86,Bushmills Original,40,Irish Blended Whiskey,23,"Who wouldn’t love this? Aromas of vanilla, malt, cream, cake batter, mashed banana, and heady florals, with a hint of dark fruit and dry spice. There is concordance between the nose and palate; the taste is sweet and honeyed, with orange, lemon and lime zest, and well-integrated spices, then becomes creamier, with custard, banana loaf, a little dark peel, and marmalade. Honey and citrus round things off nicely.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
86,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Auchroisk) 20 year old,47.9,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Lemon meringue pie, flaked almonds, cereal bars, almost porridge-like, enlivened by the tiniest pinch of allspice. A ferocious peppery intensity saves itself for the palate, where it tramples all over the lemon zest and apple flavors without mercy. Once the conquering spices call it a day, this is a sweeter concoction, with soft fudge, brown sugar, and blueberry muffin. In the finish, the allspice has the final word. (Batch 3; 162 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
86,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Dailuaine) 2007 10 year old,58.4,Single Malt Scotch,100,"This single cask, cask-strength bottling was matured in a port hogshead. Slightly sharp on the initial nose, savory, and a touch vegetal. The palate is full and malty, offering creamy toffee, hazelnuts, ripe peaches, and ginger. Creaminess lasts through the cinnamon-spiced medium-length finish. (290 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
86,Timorous Beastie 10 year old,46.8,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,47,"Soft and floral with perfumed lavender soap, peach, green apple, and parma violets. It floats in the mouth, dispensing flavors of sweet apple, custard, tangy tangerine, hard candies, green plum, marshmallow, and white pepper. Delicious and accomplished, but there’s an overlap here: it feels like the NAS version had a birthday, rather than the arrival of a new member of the family. £35",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
86,Glynnevan Cabot Triple Barrelled Canadian Rye,45,Canadian,43,"By finishing this blend of two sourced whiskies in its own maritime rum barrels, Authentic Seacoast Distillery gives this classic Canadian whisky a somehow tropical twist. Oily molasses undertones on the nose continue onto a spicy palate, which is syrupy but not slippery, with hints of wet slate, bananas, and heavy fruit. Barrel notes and suggestions of dry oak restrain an initially lush mouthfeel. (Nova Scotia only) $55 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
86,Union Horse Rolling Standard Midwestern Four Grain,46,Craft Whiskey,35,"This amber-hued whiskey seems part bourbon, part single malt, offering a nose of sweet dried fruits —raisin and apples—heaped with earthy, leathery oak. The palate is enjoyable for its crème caramel sweetness and drinkability, but the drying oak is a bit heavy-handed, overwhelming the medium body. A serviceable and versatile whiskey for the price. Corn, malted barley, wheat, and rye.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
86,Old Elk Blended Straight Bourbon,44,Craft Whiskey,50,"Initially restrained; as the nose opens up it reveals plum, red berry fruit, pine resin, and root-beer spices. The palate picks up a bit, slightly vinous in its red-fruit drive, herbal-cherry cough drop, and sweet vanilla, leading to a modest finish laced with licorice, cinnamon, and pine forest.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
86,Bird Dog Kentucky Bourbon,40,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Quite an unusual start: melted butter poured over brown rice followed by caramel, vanilla, and fried sweet potatoes. Although the ABV suggests it’s light, the body actually holds up quite well with notes of banana, quince, marzipan, bread pudding, and vanilla. Alas, the short finish doesn’t follow suit, only offering a hint of caramel.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
86,The Balvenie 2004 13 year old,58.2,Single Malt Scotch,"60,000/set","This expression was aged in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. A savory opening to the nose, followed by figs dipped in lemon juice. Sweet, spicy cream sherry on the palate, Christmas cake flavors, then black pepper and tannins develop. The finish is medium to long, with honey and malt. Accomplished, but expensive for its age.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
86,Jim Beam Distiller’s Cut,50,Bourbon/Tennessee,23,"Cornbread and toffee start this alluring whiskey, followed by hints of paprika, fruits, flowers, and caramel. Afterward, it opens up into a bakery with cinnamon rolls, caramel chews, vanilla cupcakes, and ginger. Baking spices and earth appear over a medium finish that offers black licorice. It’s well-suited for mixing.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
86,Balcones True Blue Cask Strength Corn (Batch TB17-1),68.3,Craft Whiskey,80,"Baking spices, pipe tobacco, vanilla, citrus peel, cardamom, dried apricots, and dates unwind on the nose, carried by plenty of fresh oak. The potent palate explodes with up-front sweetness, laced with cocoa and maduro tobacco notes, but the chest-thumping herbal oak brings it to a quick and slightly bitter finish. A splash of water brings the elements into better balance as peach syrup sweetness starts to shine.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
86,FEW Copper & Kings Bourbon,46.5,Craft Whiskey,50,"This is a bold style of bourbon, finished in American brandy barrels and brandishing fiery spirit and sweet corn. Yet the beautiful sweetness, layered with butter and spearmint underscored by cedary oak, offers a lot to like, especially on the nutty-sweet finish, with its peanut and charred wood flavors.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
86,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Invergordon) 1993 24 year old,54.1,Single Grain Scotch,140,"The nose evokes aromas of school textbook spines, freshly planed oak, vanilla, and dry-roasted fennel and coriander seeds. A mouth-puckering sip begins innocently enough with golden caramels and toffee, before a double whammy of spice and alcohol give it quite a kick. The sweetness concentrates deliciously, becomes tangy, before sliding into a finish of long-lingering spices and residual oaky sweetness. (Cask no. 901820; 168 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
86,George Remus Straight Bourbon,47,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Cotton candy, caramel, baked apples, roasted pecans, freshly baked rye rolls, and herbs start a truly approachable pour. Its story opens in a spice race: cinnamon, nutmeg, turmeric, and smoked paprika and a slight hint of coffee. A burst of dill hits, just before vanilla walks it home to a lovely, medium finish. An interesting sipper, but remarkable in cocktails.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
86,Sierra Norte Single Barrel White,45,World Whisky,50,"White has the most familiar corn whiskey character of this Mexican trio. Sweet buttered cobs of corn, faint toasted spices, green corn husks, and peanuts on the nose. The palate is sweet, gentle, and refreshing, bathed in honey, with dried peel, sweet corn, toasted oak spices, and a late sensation of charred oak, burnt toast, and peppercorn. That slight burnt note just creeps into the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
86,Shieldaig 14 year old,40,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Bottled by Ian Macleod Distillers from an undisclosed producer, this Islay single malt may well emanate from Ardbeg. The nose offers lemon, rock pools, peat ash, and smoky malt, with a sweet, honeyed floral note at its heart. Medium-bodied, with big citrus flavors, tingling spices, brine, ashy peat, and aniseed. Aniseed lingers in the finish, with diminishing spiciness.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
86,"Booker’s 2017-02 “Blue Knights Batch,” 63.7%",,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Think corn: roasted, canned, creamed, mashed, pan-fried, in salsa, and in bread. The corn pops early and often. This complements hazelnut, caramel pudding, and baking spices. A drop of water really opens this up, softening the corn-heavy notes and bringing forth fruits and spices. Even the finish is better with water. Perhaps this whiskey was meant to have a lower proof.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
86,Ohishi Brandy Cask,41.6,Japanese,75,"Lemon, lime, ripening apple, spring florals, clementine, and pear, among lilting sweet brandy notes. Calming, contemplative, and restful aromas. The mouthfeel is slightly musty, almost granular, with creamy light vanilla and juicy lemon and lime. The tip of the tongue burns brightly with warm spices. It grows heavier, the tastes shifting to lemon bonbons as the spice is annulled. A dying gasp of lemon peel, candy sweetness, and aromatic spices.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
86,Grangestone Sherry Finish,40,Single Malt Scotch,29,"Matured for 6 to 8 years in bourbon casks before finishing in sherry casks. The early nose is earthy, with dough balls, then sweeter sherry notes emerge, with ripe tangerines and honey. Sweet sherry fills the full palate with black pepper and developing raisins. Plain chocolate, black pepper, and aniseed in the relatively long finish. Distillery not disclosed.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
86, J. Mossman Platinum Crown 15 year old,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,54,"Nutty nose, with toasted oak, savory peppered meats, and traces of wood smoke. It starts off deceptively lightweight, with sweet juicy mandarin before a takeover of sharper citrus elements. Honey and gorgeous silky caramels slink by, chased by a gentle swish of spice. Light pepperiness with chocolate notes ushers in an aromatic finish. A tasty blend, but the nose will not be everyone’s choice.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
86,Egan’s Vintage Grain,46,Single Grain Irish Whiskey,45,"From vintage 2009, this bourbon cask matured whiskey is around the 8 year mark. Vanilla custard tarts, digestive biscuits, green vegetal notes, and scents of a bakery counter pull you in. Caramel, active spices, soft fruits, peach, apple, pear, pepper, and golden sultana flavors, but as the caramels slide into toffee the grain character becomes more evident into the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Compass Box Affinity,46,Miscellaneous,150,"Egon Spengler warned ‘Don’t cross the streams,’ and it feels as though the calvados dominates the flavors of Scotch whisky in this rich, sweet mash-up. After a nose of vanilla essence and oxidized apple notes, the palate brings baked apple, brown sugar, caramel syrup, and clove, with lighter vanilla notes rebounding off the sticky apple flavors. Long warming finish, with more calvados sweetness and pounding spices. (6,028 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
87,Jefferson’s Reserve Pritchard Hill Cabernet Cask-Finished,45.1,Bourbon/Tennessee,70,"Cherry bubble gum, white grape juice, hazelnuts, brown sugar, and rye bread on the nose. The palate is bright and gently spiced, with a soft, creamy texture and restrained grape, black tea, nut, and chocolate flavors. Coffee beans, nutty chocolate, and persistent oak on the finish. Surprisingly austere for a wine cask-finished bourbon, but to good effect.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Ardmore Legacy,40,Single Malt Scotch,40,"A mix of 80% peated and 20% unpeated malt. Charcuterie, cinnamon, vanilla, and caramel on the nose. Vanilla, honey, ginger, and subtle peat smoke on the citric palate. Spicy peat and cereal notes in the medium-length finish. <em>Best Values</em>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
87,Balvenie 12 year old The Sweet Toast of American Oak,43,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Matured primarily in bourbon barrels for 12 years before a 3-month finish in slow-toasted virgin American oak barrels from Kelvin Cooperage in Kentucky. Honey, vanilla, cloves, dried fruit, and lively oak on the nose. The palate features citrus fruit and more cloves, with milk chocolate, honey, walnuts, and lots of wood spice. Raisins and black tea in the medium-length finish. (30,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
87,Macallan 12 year old Sherry Oak,43,Single Malt Scotch,70,"This is the youngest Sherry Oak expression available. A classic Macallan nose of sherry, baking Christmas cake, dried fruits, hot butter, and old leather. Jaffa oranges, brittle toffee, and light oak on the smooth, full palate. Relatively long in the finish, with spice, malt, oak, and a final hint of smoke.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
87,New Holland Beer Barrel-Finished Bourbon,40,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Aromatic and expressive on the nose, with grapefruit, lemon, and orange peels, kiwi, green apple Hi-Chew, melon, and a hint of pine and dried leaves. The palate is light-bodied and clean, with citrus peel, melon, soft spice, sarsaparilla, and milk chocolate. It finishes short and gentle, but tasty, with candied rose petal, dried kiwi, and grape Fun Dip. While many beer-barrel finishes come on too strong, this one succeeds with subtlety",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Jack Daniel’s No. 27 Gold,40,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"Like opening a lunchbox in elementary school: you’ll find the distinct aromas of peanut butter sandwich with strawberry jam and a smear of Marshmallow Fluff, plus a Little Debbie Oatmeal Cream Pie, and some apple blossom and tea rose. Soft and sweet in the mouth, with plenty of fruit and flowers: banana split topped with crushed pistachios, rose oil, white chocolate, halva. This whiskey is finished in charred maple barrels and undergoes a second filtration with the Lincoln County Process.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Gordon & MacPhail Private Collection 1968 (distilled at Caol Ila),52.5,Single Malt Scotch,"15,000","Coal smoke, brine, machine oil, and herbal notes on the nose of this 50 year old, along with a hint of menthol and ultimately, floral notes. Dark berries on the palate, bitter orange, plus sea salt. The finish is long and slightly smoky, overtly oaky, with black pepper notes. (50 bottles in U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
87,Seven Stills Patience Single Pot Still-Style,59.5,American Whiskey (Unspecified),75,"Waxy and fragrant, with citrus oil, tea bag, furniture polish, dried flowers, cooked apple, and malt. At this proof, the palate demands water, which tames its heat to reveal candied rose petal, dried ginger, apple, almond, pistachio, lemon pepper, pine resin, and some ashiness. It finishes waxy, with charred pecans, cigar end, bitter oak, and black pepper. There are some unusual juxtapositions here, but they work. (302 bottles)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,James E. Pepper 1776 Straight 100 Proof,50,Rye Whiskey,30,"Classic rye notes of orange and pepper spice along with vanilla custard. A full mouthfeel presages a palate of lemon meringue pie, whipped cream, caramel, baking spice, and herbaceous notes of pine and dill, but also tropical flavors, melon, and peach. A lengthy finish that’s full and rich, offering chocolate and reprising the tropical notes of pineapple and orange on the back note. Quite powerful, solid, and reliable.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
87,Ragtime Bottled in Bond Straight,50,Rye Whiskey,49,"New York Distilling Co.’s first bonded whiskey, which also conforms to the voluntary Empire Rye standards. It’s herbaceous and grain-driven on the nose, with licorice, dried mint, brown sugar, peanut oil, and buttered pecans. The dry palate is remarkably light, with flavors of black pepper, walnuts, licorice, mint, orange, and tart cherries. Oak, roasted nuts, and dark chocolate on the finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Wilderness Trail Small Batch Bottled in Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Batch D02),50,Bourbon/Tennessee,48,"Despite some obvious youth, the aromas here are enjoyable, as Honey Nut Cheerios and bake shop sticky buns and cinnamon rolls hearken to the primary grain flavors. Fruity banana, Raisinets, and lots of fresh oak are apparent. Marmalade and citrus oil flavors are tasty, but the gingerbread heat and raw oak suggest it would benefit from additional maturation.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2019
87,Mayor Pingree Red Label Straight (Batch No. 001),47,Bourbon/Tennessee,48,"Herbal, citrus, and subtle oak aromas mingle with grape soda, ground ginger, iced tea, and cinnamon Teddy Grahams on the nose. Medium-bodied and well-spiced, it’s a little hot, but softens with water and develops nicely in the glass, showing flavors of chocolate, nuts, grape jelly, and blueberry compote. The finish is sweet with cooked berries, chocolate, oak, and subtle spice. Made by Valentine Distilling Co. in Ferndale, Michigan.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Scottish Leader Blended Malt,40,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,37,"Another classic label introduces its blended malt alter ego: this is much fruitier than Scottish Leader on first impression, with apple, pear, lime zest, apricot tart, sherry notes, and a trace of spice. Apple pie filling with clove and ginger spices, plus vanilla, dark toffee, hard candies, citrus, and nougat peak early, then ride the crest of a wave until a gingersnap and spice finish. <em>(Travel Retail)</em> £30",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
87,Strathcolm 12 year old,40,Single Grain Scotch,41,"The oldest in the Strathcolm trio of whiskies, this has greater depth and richness on the nose, with caramel, ground hazelnut, whole-wheat bagels, honey, and fragrant roasted spices. With cinnamon-dusted Quaker Oats, honey, vanilla, and spice on the tongue, this has more body, with deeply toasted spice and honey sweetness on the finish. (3,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
87,Founding Spirits American Whiskey (Batch 10),50,American Whiskey (Unspecified),45,"Distilled from corn, oats, wheat, and barley at Copper Fox Distillery and blended by Founding Spirits. The nose has clean, sweet applewood smoke, raw peanuts, oolong tea, grain, and treacle. On the palate there’s strong oak, but it’s well-tempered by spice, smoke, savory nuts, grilled apples, and chalky saline minerality. The finish is savory and nutty—appetite-inducing—and overall, it takes water well.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
87,Bladnoch 17 year old,46.7,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Ripe peaches, vanilla, sweet oak, and milky coffee on the nose. The palate is luscious and smooth, with sweet orange notes and cinnamon.

87,Glengoyne The Legacy Series Chapter One,48,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Dates, brittle toffee, dried fruits, and old leather on the nose, then a hint of ripe peaches surfaces. Smooth in the mouth, with sherry, damsons, more dried fruits, and background pipe tobacco smoke. Prune juice in the finish, which is drying, and ultimately quite oaky, with white pepper.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2019
87,Glenkinchie 12 year old,43,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Floral on the nose and quite delicate, with citrus fruit, spicy vanilla, walnuts, and cereal.

87,Glenrothes 12 year old,40,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Light berry fruit notes, with resin, walnuts, and icing sugar on the nose.

87,Tamnavulin Double Cask,40,Single Malt Scotch,40,"The first house release of Tamnavulin since the 1990s. Sherry, hazelnuts, ginger, cinnamon, and milk chocolate on the nose.

87,Bushmills The Steamship Collection Rum Cask Reserve,40,Irish Single Malt,130,"Jaffa orange, flowers, hard candies, rose water, and light spices make a rather muted offering. Fortunately there’s a sweet, malty mouthful of fudge, orange shred, gingerbread, and candied orange slices, with a nibble of peppercorn spices and a finish of clove-studded orange. Tasty and well-balanced, salvaging the less than inspiring nose. (Travel Retail)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
87,Chicken Cock Heritage Reserve,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,38,"A light and sweet bourbon, with butterscotch candy, toasted coconut, lemon curd, marshmallow, and a bit of chalkiness on the nose. The palate is floral, tending toward cedar and sandalwood perfume, with marzipan, milk chocolate, and orange. It finishes with hookah tobacco, toasted oak, and almonds.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Chicken Cock Bootlegger’s Reserve,45,American Whiskey (Unspecified),40,"This blend of bourbon and rye offers quince, kiwi, jasmine, honey, vanilla, angel food cake, sultanas, and lemon meringue on the nose. The palate is somewhat barrel-forward, but offers coconut, banana flan, maple syrup, cinnamon, roasted almonds, and lemon, with an appealing char note. The finish is gently spicy, smooth, and light, ending with sweet vanilla and soft oak. Perhaps a bit closed at times, and lacks some cohesiveness, but it’s very easy to enjoy.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
87,West Cork Barrel Proof (2018 Release),62,Blended Irish Whiskey,55,"Uh-oh, here comes trouble. Sourdough, lemon, toffee, creamy vanilla, banana bread, and a few floral notes compete with the intimidating high alcohol. It begins with orange-shred marmalade, fleeting nutty-chocolate notes, and lots of peppery spice before a substantial onslaught of alcohol tramples the taste buds. Sure, it can be tamed with water, but is that really the point? Provocative, hedonistic, raw, and reckless; I’m very glad it’s around. (5,300 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
87,Dublin Liberties Murder Lane 13 year old,46,Irish Single Malt,179,"Darryl McNally’s killer new whiskey was finished in Tokaj casks and launched to coincide with the opening of their new distillery. Inhaling the volatiles evokes scents of lime, sugar-sprinkled puff pastry, sweet and sour plum, toasted oak, and Chinese five spice. The waxy mouthfeel, with cooked fruit, sweet vanilla, marzipan, orange, and plum, is silenced when the trigger is pulled on the pepper, allspice, and clove ending. Well-executed. €160",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
87,Tincup American Whiskey,42,American Whiskey (Unspecified),30,"A blend of high-rye bourbon from Indiana and a small amount of Colorado single malt. Black tea, cooked stone fruits, blackberry jam, white pepper, and cinnamon toast on the nose. The palate is sweet and light, with hot cocoa mix, toasted oak, cola, iced tea, orange, and clove that crescendos in a flash of heat and then subsides. Dried blueberries, dark chocolate, and integrated oak on the finish. Water not recommended. <em>Best Value</em>",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Davidson Reserve Four Grain Tennessee Straight (Batch 2018-002),50,Bourbon/Tennessee,45,"Unbaked pastry dough, swirled with brown sugar and chopped almonds, meets orange blossom water, cream soda, coconut flakes, and pistachio pudding. There’s more pastry, toasted coconut and almonds, cinnamon, brown sugar, and orange on the palate, along with plenty of oak. A splash of water goes a long way to emphasize the prettier flavors while playing down some of the youthful heat.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Ballyhoo,43,Irish,30,"Connacht Whiskey Co. finished 4 year old grain whiskey in port barrels for 3 to 6 months in this new and improved recipe. Cherry soda, rose hip, lemon zest, vanilla frosting, and dry grass aromas with a taste of damson, cherry, redcurrant jelly, pepper, and a good lift of sugary sweetness.

87,Driftless Glen Rye,48,Rye Whiskey,50,"Classical fruity rye notes of orange, green apple, and blueberry on the nose, along with fresh-baked muffin and a whiff of new oak. The palate is somewhat arch at first, but it quickly melts into honey, warm chocolate sauce, caramel, cinnamon, baking spice, orange candy, walnut, and a hint of pipe tobacco. The finish is light and well-balanced, with more orange, along with chocolate malt, caramel, iced tea, and black pepper.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
87,Hotel Tango Whiskey,45,American Whiskey (Unspecified),50,"An American whiskey from Indianapolis-based Hotel Tango. The nose has notes of slate, herbs, tea, lemon peel, bitter orange, and vanilla wafer. The palate is somewhat green, with raisin, cinnamon candy, vanillin, grenadine, bitter chocolate, pecan, and cracked pepper. The finish is long and flavorful, offering orange, cherry, vanilla ice cream, mocha, and licorice. Perhaps too much wood influence, but water balances it well, creating a smooth, complex, and enjoyable whiskey.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
87,Treaty Oak Ghost Hill Texas,47.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Fruity and fresh, there are aromas of Juicy Fruit gum, honeydew, underripe bananas, and floral notes—a garden in bloom. The palate retains freshness with herbaceous flavors of parsley and cucumber, as well as melon, licorice, white pepper, and a pop of cumin. Oak, pepper, licorice, and bouquet garni on the finish. Unconventional but enjoyable flavors, driven by the still.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Treaty Oak Red Handed,47.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Fresh oak on the nose, floral notes, baked apple, bananas, and chocolate malt. The palate is light and slightly green, with herbal parsley notes, lime, and lemon, then expanding to vanilla, bitter chocolate, peanut shells, pepper, and tobacco.

87,Cream of Kentucky 11 year old Straight,51,Bourbon/Tennessee,150,"The dried fruit, almost like Fruit Roll-Ups, quickly veers toward circus peanuts candy, taffy, and bubble gum, with notes of herbs— especially dill. The palate remains a bit of a fruit bomb, with banana, peach puree, dried papaya, and other tropical fruits, then clove and allspice add some complexity. A flavorful, if slightly peculiar bourbon dominated by tutti-frutti flavors and dill.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2019
87,Crooked Water Kings Point Port Wine Barrel Finished,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"The nose is loaded with jasmine, orange blossoms, fresh peaches, gummy bears, red wine, grape fruit leather, and lashings of vanilla. In the mouth, it’s a mixed berry bonanza—raspberry, blueberry, and strawberry—with cherry, Red Vines, chocolate, and a hint of tobacco leaf. Though light, with a somewhat short finish, it’s well-balanced and tasty.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Crooked Water Old Hell Roaring Double Barreled Straight,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"This undergoes secondary maturation in heavily toasted and smoked new charred oak barrels, but you wouldn’t know it from the delicate nose, redolent with white flowers, Asian pear, cardamom, toasted almonds, and milk chocolate; the only hint is a bit of burnt sugar and dry leaves. On the palate, those special barrels reveal themselves with flavors of cedar, black pepper, chipotle, and barbecue potato chips, as well as apple, pecan, and milk chocolate. The finish has chili-chocolate and long, polished oak.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Devils River Texas Rye,45,Rye Whiskey,30,"Orange rind, pineapple, and tropical aromas on the nose. The palate has notes of chocolate milkshake, with nuttiness and a hint of espresso. Water brings out more tropical flavors, bitter chocolate, and a light char note. A bit hot, but the finish is balanced and reasonably long—chocolaty, lemony, with more of the charred note and some tobacco leaf. Not quite as full-bodied as it might be, but a solid rye expression nonetheless.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
87,Rebellion Rye,43,Rye Whiskey,36,"Give the nose time to open up, and it reveals herbal and earthy aromas, with fennel, dill, root beer, and evergreen forest, as well as sprinklings of cinnamon and cloves. The palate is chewy and vivacious, although the proof keeps the heat in check; flavors of chocolate, clove, allspice, orange oil, and nutty oak are ultimately enfolded in cigar wrapper, black pepper, and orange Creamsicle.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Eight & Sand Blended Bourbon,44,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"A blend of straight bourbons and American whiskeys, all aged at least 4 years, this is fruit cocktail in a glass: cherries, blackberries, wild strawberries, and sweet orange, along with allspice, clove, nutmeg, and a hint of cedar. Sweet, viscous, and full in the mouth, with more fruit (cooked cherry, orange peel, peach), spices, and plenty of oak all the way to the finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
87,Signal Hill,40,Canadian,35,"Legendary Canadian whisky blender Mike Booth blends small batches within sight of Newfoundland’s Signal Hill, using 95% corn and 5% barley whiskies matured in new oak, bourbon, and Canadian whisky barrels.

87,MacNair’s Lum Reek Peated,46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,50,"Rich fruit, spiced orange, fudge, fragrant spices, and sweet, playful smoke make for a splendid nosing experience. The piscine flavors, however, may best suit smokeheads, as, along with fudge and vanilla, this has a splendid flavor of oily, smoky kippers. Golden syrup, green apple, and black pepper emerge, but the smoked-fish flavors spill into the finish to swim with pepper and fruity sweetness.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
87,Woodford Reserve Master’s Collection Oat Grain Bourbon,42.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,130,"The oak juts out a bit in this otherwise fresh and pleasant bourbon, where toasted oak meets cake batter, Honey Nut Cheerios, and porridge with pecans. It’s lacking much in the way of a ‘wow factor,’ but following the slightly tart fruit palate is a redeeming finish, balancing tasty apricot and bright citrus peel with drying oak tannins.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
87,Glenmorangie Original,43,Single Malt Scotch,40,"Original is eager to please, yet not lacking complexity. A soft nose features honey, vanilla, sweet orange, and caramel. Hazelnuts dipped in honey and more orange, along with red apples on the rounded, buttery palate. Vanilla and cocoa powder in the lightly spiced finish, which boasts just a hint of smoke.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2019
87,Glenmorangie Quinta Ruban 12 year old,46,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Matured in bourbon casks for 10 years, followed by 2 years of finishing in ruby port pipes from the quintas, or wine estates, of Portugal. Stewed fruits, cloves, and port-soaked oak on the nose, which carry over to the sweet, viscous palate, along with milky coffee, fruit spices, and cereal. The overall effect of sticky sweetness lingers through the finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2019
87,Oban Bay Reserve,43,Single Malt Scotch,63,"An appropriately dark bottle and label are featured for the Night’s Watch bottling. Tangy citrus fruit, brittle toffee, and vanilla on the nose. Nicely textured in the mouth, with tangerine segments in cream, developing nuttiness, milky coffee, and a hint of char. Lively spices, toffee, and aniseed in the medium-length, slightly oaky finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2019
87,Royal Lochnagar 12 year old,40,Single Malt Scotch,65,"House Baratheon is represented with a label depicting a crown-wearing rampant stag. An undemanding dram, with soft toffee, cream, baked apples, and a hint of ginger on the nose. The palate is light, with brittle toffee, soft fruit notes, and oak. Drying in the finish, through aniseed and wood spice.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2019
87,Singleton of Glendullan Select,40,Single Malt Scotch,30,"This showcases House Tully’s leaping fish sigil. The nose yields honey, barley sugar, walnuts, and plums. The palate is straightforward and approachable, with green apples, orange juice, and delicate spice. The finish is medium in length, with toffee and mildly spicy oak.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2019
87,McKenzie Bottled in Bond,50,Bourbon/Tennessee,43,"Pineapple rings, lemon and orange wedges, and brown sugar aromas offset fresh pine and a bundle of herbs: basil, tarragon, fennel. The chewy palate is herbal and savory, with licorice, dark chocolate, roasted cherry, and plenty of oak, yielding to pineapple, orange, and lemon on the finish. The bump-up in proof from its non-bonded sibling bourbon yields nice results when adding water, which softens and expands the flavors.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
87,Smooth Ambler Old Scout American Whiskey (Batch 31),49.5,American Whiskey (Unspecified),35,"A clean and inviting nose featuring fresh hay, cooked corn, Peanut Chews, vanilla custard, and black pepper. Chewy and mouth-filling texture, with black cherry, peanuts in Coke, caramel, peanut-butter molasses cookies, and supple spices, ending with more cherry and mature oak flavors. Straightforward, uncomplicated, and satisfying: a good all-rounder.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
87,Filibuster Straight Rye Dual Cask Finished,45,Rye Whiskey,41,"The nose begins with an aroma of orange peel, followed by a lively parade of black pepper, rye spice, cardamom, and tilled earth, then sweeter back notes of molasses and cinnamon stick. There’s pleasant heat and spice on the palate, starting with black pepper and then chocolate, powdered-sugar French toast, orange, treacle, cooked apple, and allspice. A lengthy, toasty, chocolaty finish, with another pleasant note of orange and some peppery spice.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
87,Seven Stills Fireweed,59.5,Miscellaneous,75,"Distilled from an “aggressively hopped” IPA, aged in new charred oak, and finished in Islay scotch casks. Cured and grilled meat on the nose—I’m reminded of Lexington, NC-style barbecue—along with chicory coffee and apple blossom. Hoppy and piney flavors reveal the beer wash and are joined by orange, lemon Pine-Sol, pecans, chocolate, oak, black pepper, and restrained smoke. The finish brings it all in: smoked oak, zingy lemon, bittersweet chocolate, and hops. This whiskey will have its fans and detractors; in context, it offers unique and enjoyable flavors. 396 bottles",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
87,Cotswolds Founder’s Choice,60.9,Single Malt English Whisky,86,"Dedicated to Dr. Jim Swan, who encouraged Cotswolds Distillery to shave, toast, and re-char red wine barriques, this has developed aromas of cherry, dried goji berries, rose petal, vanilla cake mix, butterscotch, and muted spices. It still feels young at this mighty strength. Warm red fruits of cherry and strawberry slam into a distortion of allspice, clove, and tongue-searing alcohols, which are quelled eventually by sweet notes of creamy toffee and mint. (3,000 bottles) £65",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
87,Minor Case Sherry Cask Finished Rye,,Rye Whiskey,50,"The sherry cask finish asserts itself right up front, with orange oil, sweet figs, cloves, and cedar; aromas of grape candy, peonies, spearmint, and allspice appear as well. While this is unabashedly a rye, with flavors of cinnamon, black pepper, and oak, the sherry comes to the fore again in the guise of grape soda, sweet cherries, and chocolate. The finish is sweet and oak-driven, with good length.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
87,Restless Spirits Gullytown Double Barrel Single Malt,46,Single Malt American Whiskey,60,"This American single malt is aged in two separate bourbon barrels—one new and one used. A malty, earthy nose of slate is followed by notes of coriander and orange peel, as well as iced tea, ginger, and dark chocolate. The palate offers espresso, bitter orange, more chocolate, and grilled pineapple. A long, rich finish of orange, mocha, black pepper, and pipe tobacco. Rich, malty, and flavorful—some enjoyable sipping here.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
87,Sons of Erin 15 year old,46,Irish Blended Whiskey,110,"Bourbon barrel matured, then finished in apple brandy casks as a limited edition, this is more malty than their regular bottlings, with aromas of melon, lemon, vanilla, sour gooseberry, and faint banana custard. It’s thicker texture rewards with sweet fudge, vanilla, ripe banana, hints of pecan, and spice, though it’s bedded down within the dessert flavors. A lengthy finish of lemon curd.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
87,Monkey Shoulder,43,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,33,"Never more than an arm’s length away from most bartenders, this blended malt, launched in 2005, has been a game changer. Bottled at a higher strength, this has fresh green apples, buttercream, lime, and kumquat, with a fresh acidic tartness, butterscotch, crushed peppercorn, and dried chili flakes. Dark toffee, Brazil nut, chocolate, peppery spices, and toasted oak on the palate. Lively finish of spice and chocolate toffee. <em>Best Value</em>",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
87,Jefferson’s Reserve Twin Oak Custom Barrel,45.1,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"This nose is all dry, earthy oak, tightly wrapped in rawhide, but underneath lurks plenty of sweetness, like overripe bananas, with the slight bitterness of citrus oils or orange pekoe tea adding balance. Pleasing coffee and mocha flavors also emerge on the palate, but the oak feels poorly integrated, with a green-stick quality. Finished for 4 months in a custom grooved barrel. (42,000 bottles)",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
87,Bunnahabhain Palo Cortado Cask Finish (1997 vintage),54.9,Single Malt Scotch,350,"One of six whiskies released in Distell’s first Malt Collection. This received a secondary maturation of almost 2 years in Palo Cortado casks, rarely used for Scotch whisky. Melon slices sprinkled with salt, vanilla, and finally, peach blossom on the nose. More peaches on the spicy palate, with milk chocolate and oak. Peppery in the medium-length finish, with aniseed. (1,644 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
87,Glenfiddich Fire and Cane,43,Single Malt Scotch,50,"The fourth release in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series, this expression comprises peated and unpeated single malt, matured in bourbon barrels and then finished for 3 months in Latin American rum casks. A nose of spiced rum, vanilla, ripe pears, and pipe tobacco. Baked apple, sweet oak, and cinder toffee on the palate, with ashy smoke. Peppery sweet peat, rum, and brittle toffee in the relatively short finish. <em>Best Value</em>",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
87,Laphroaig Cairdeas Fino Cask,51.8,Single Malt Scotch,80,"‘Cairdeas’ is Gaelic for ‘friendship.’ This bottling was aged in first-fill bourbon casks before a finishing period in fino sherry casks. The nose offers lemon cheesecake smoked in peat, with brine, almonds, and oysters. Full and rounded on the palate, with stewed fruits, ashy peat, antiseptic, and more brine. The lengthy finish features licorice, tar, rock salt, phenols, and citrus fruits.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
87,Old Pulteney 12 year old,43,Single Malt Scotch,45,"The only survivor from Old Pulteney’s core range shake-up of 2018, this has been matured in first and second-fill bourbon casks.

The medium-length finish is nutty, with wood spices.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
87,Old Pulteney Huddart,46,Single Malt Scotch,58,"This NAS expression is part of the new 2018 Old Pulteney core lineup. Initially matured in second-fill American oak and bourbon casks, it was finished in bourbon casks that previously held heavily peated whisky. Sweet woodsmoke, crème brûlée, green apples, and cinder toffee on the nose. The smoke is more peat-induced on the palate, with banana fritters, and subtly sprinkled with sea salt. The finish features caramel and herbal notes.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
87,Deerhammer American Single Malt,46,Craft Whiskey,54,"This porter-style, 100% malted barley single malt has a nose of dark chocolate and coffee beans that’s also slightly herbal, with a note of wood and a subtle, pleasant sweetness. Toasted oak leads on the palate, with sugared espresso, cinnamon, dried flowers, and an ashy back note. More coffee, chocolate, and coconut punctuate the finish. Aged at least 2 years, this whiskey is surprisingly complex considering its relative youth, and is quite unique.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
87,Manatawny Still Works Keystone Whiskey,45,Craft Whiskey,40,"This whiskey is made from four separate mashbills of malt, wheat, oats, and rye, and aged in oak for 12 to 36 months. There’s a subtle spiciness on the nose, as well as lemon, orange peel and a hint of sandalwood. The palate has notes of rice pudding, maple syrup, malt, chocolate, and honey.

87,Sagamore Spirit Double Oak Rye,48.3,Rye Whiskey,69,"A classic rye nose, with aromas of pancakes, butterscotch, vanilla, and baking spices.

87,Grangestone 12 year old Highland,40,Single Malt Scotch,34,"An Easter basket of aromas and flavors. Delicately floral on the nose, with rose petals, hibiscus, fresh-squeezed orange juice, and a hint of pastry shop. Similar characteristics show on the palate, where sweetness stops short of saccharine: orange cream candies, bubble gum, and cherry soda lead into a short finish with a jelly-bean sweetness. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Jamie Stewart,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,16,"An entrancing nose shows ripe apples and peaches, blueberry pie, earthy and saline peat, and fresh citrus. Although light, the palate has an enjoyable fruity character with layers of grapefruit, candy apple, kettle corn, wild berry, and orange Creamsicle. Water does not benefit this—drink it as-is. Aged at least 5 years. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,MacQueens of Scotland 12 year old,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,22,"A delicate blend that manages to express richness in its simplicity. Perfumy and floral on the nose. On the palate, coconut, marzipan, and golden raisin flavors show the grain component, but they’re buttressed by chocolate, strawberries, and orange oil, leading into a satisfying oak and chocolate-orange finish. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Grant’s Triple Wood,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,17,"Refill bourbon, American oak, and virgin oak are the woods in question. Technically, they are all American oak, just at different flavor-giving stages of their productive lives. Honey, fresh apricot, floral, and supple barley notes, candied orange, star anise, dried chili, and a touch of aniseed. Exceptionally smooth with caramel, date, red fruits, chocolate, and pecan pie, finishing with wood char and spice. One wood three ways, I grant you. Previously labeled as Grant’s Family Reserve",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
87,Breuckelen 77 Bonded Rye,50,Craft Whiskey,60,"Part of Breuckelen Distilling’s Bonded Series, this rye starts with fresh wood and some candied fruit on the nose, as well as vanilla frosting, lemon, and cigar wrapper.

A strong finish has notably good length and reveals more flavors of dark chocolate, raspberries, blueberries, black cherries, licorice, and gentle wood spices.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
87,ScotchMe!,44.4,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,34,"And you shall be scotched: vanilla, fudge, eraser-tipped pencils, spoonfuls of thick lemon curd, rhubarb compote, root ginger, and cumin. This malty dram has a decent weight behind it, with rich caramel, chocolate-flavored toffee, deep notes of orange and zested limes, plum fruit, and well-balanced peppery spices. A little spice, dusty chocolate, and Horlicks on the finish. A solid whisky, so just holler if you want some. (1,200 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
87,Hotel Tango Bravo Bourbon,45,Craft Whiskey,60,"Fresh wood, pine forest, and grassy meadow greet you on the nose—followed by lemon, coriander, and some warmer notes of ginger and shortbread. The palate is sweet, with chocolate, caramel, hints of almond, licorice, cinnamon, and clove, balanced against notes of anise, pine nuts, dill, and black pepper. The finish is punctuated by polished oak and spiced chocolate. This craft expression is youthful, but is also dynamic and complex.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
87,Vesey’s Straight Bourbon,47,Craft Whiskey,48,"This bourbon from South Carolina’s Charleston Distilling Co. has a nose that starts with a chalky minerality, but fruit leather, strawberry, and blueberry quickly emerge, along with notes of candy corn, caramel, and chocolate fondue. The palate offers bitter chocolate, grape, and cherry, with caramel, roasted nuts, and coconut lingering on the back palate. The finish is nutty and bittersweet, with lingering fruitiness on a warm and chocolaty finish.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
87,Whiskey Acres Rye,43.5,Craft Whiskey,45,"This high-rye expression (75% rye) has a nose of citrus, dried tea leaves, and a fennel note, rounded out by a pleasant sweetness that’s laced with Christmas cake, cocoa, clove, and cinnamon. The palate is rich chocolate balanced by citrus oil, nutmeg, walnut, and white pepper. The finish is warm, silky, and full. Well integrated, balanced, and sophisticated, this whiskey is elegant beyond its age.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
87,Trader Joe’s 10 year old Highland,40,Single Malt Scotch,26,"Saline and earthy on the nose, lifted up by green apple, Juicy Fruit gum, and mango. A pleasant smokiness—more cigar wrapper than peat—wafts through the palate’s juicy roundness of mango, green apple, and Red Vines. More tobacco leaf and toasted oak on the finish. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Trader Joe’s Ardmore 10 year old Highland (Distilled in 2008),40,Single Malt Scotch,33,"Mineral and saline peat and brine, along with a slight rubberiness, are balanced by white pepper, orange marmalade, lemon, herbs, and grilled apples on the nose. The drying and smoky palate is light-bodied, but with generous peat, lemon, and herb flavors, finishing with oak, smoke, and more lemon. If you’re looking for a peated single malt that’s more gentle in body, try this one. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Trader Joe’s GlenAllachie 13 year old Speyside (Distilled in 2004),40,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Earthiness and aromas of toffee apple, stewed fruit, ginger, allspice, walnuts, and dried figs sweep into a sweet, raisiny palate that also has flavors of candied nuts, semi-dark chocolate, dried fruit, caramel, and apples. Sweet, with almonds and chocolate on the finish—lots of tasty sherry flavors here, but an uncomplicated character. (<em>Trader Joe’s</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Ainsley Brae 12 year old (Distilled at Royal Brackla),40,Single Malt Scotch,65,"An array of tropical fruit aromas—guava, papaya, green banana—mingle with incense, fresh herbs, and homemade cranberry sauce. The palate is light, silky, and flavorful: strawberry, pineapple, grapefruit soda, and milk chocolate, with a brief cigar-wrapper finish. A higher proof would go a long way to turn this whisky from merely pleasant to excellent. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,Glen Ness 12 year old Highland,40,Single Malt Scotch,28,"Classic sherry aromas of raisins, hazelnuts, dark chocolate, and cooked plums prime the palate, but pay attention: a hint of peat is there, presenting beautifully as smoke and saline, along with sweet almond, gingerbread, chocolate-covered raisins, and hazelnuts.

Chewy tannins provide a foil for lively spice on the palate—pepper, ginger, anise, cinnamon—while orange oil, cola, cherry cordial, and black tea provide supporting notes. The finish shows generous earthiness and oak. Takes water well.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
87,The Famous Grouse Ruby Cask,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,35,"The port cask finish wraps the toffee and baked orange in an extra layer of richness. There is subtlety in the aroma of the port notes, with red cherry and dried cranberry mingling with well-integrated spices in the background. Richer dark caramels infused with red fruits, including cranberry, red currant, and pomegranate, chased by feisty spices. The finish has concentrated red fruit juices, nougat, and long-lasting spices.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Johnnie Walker Black Label Triple Cask Edition,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,40,"This lighter, fruity, spicy whisky is not for peat lovers. Bourbon, whisky, and rum casks were used for finishing, resulting in a nose of rich honey, golden syrup, peach stone, apricot, honeydew, coriander seed, ginger, and white pepper. Citrus, butter fudge, dried and tropical fruits, rumbling spices, and tangy orange create a creamy combination, from which a familiar Johnnie Walker identity suddenly snaps into place. (<em>Travel Retail exclusive</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Wild Turkey Longbranch,43,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Redolent of marshmallow and vanilla, this is restrained on the nose, but revels in pretty sweetness, with peaches and cream, ripe banana, and circus peanuts candies. On the palate, this collaboration with actor Matthew McConaughey betrays some of its Wild Turkey pedigree, capturing the house earthiness. For its modest proof, it pours a bit hot on the palate, with plenty of oak tannins, making it a nice sipper on the rocks or with water. <em>Value pick</em>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
87,Arran 10 year old,46,Single Malt Scotch,50,"Launched in 2006 as the first mainstream Arran bottling with an age statement, it is sweet and malty on the nose, with fresh-planed wood and toffee apples. The palate is fruity, with ripe banana, honey, vanilla, coconut, and wood spices. Spicy orchard fruits and malt in the relatively long finish. Well-balanced and eminently drinkable at this age. The quality has improved since earlier bottlings.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
87,Balvenie Peat Week 14 year old (2003 Vintage),48.3,Single Malt Scotch,99,"This follows the first limited release of the 2002 vintage Peat Week. Like its predecessor, this was distilled during the distillery’s annual week of peated production. Significantly peatier on the nose than the 2002, with Islay-like phenols backed by sweet floral notes. Sweet smoke, vanilla, citrus fruits, and honey on the bold palate, while the finish features more vanilla and honey, plus spicy bonfire smoke.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
87,Glenfiddich 14 year old Bourbon Barrel Reserve,43,Single Malt Scotch,54,"After 14 years in bourbon wood, this was finished in heavily-charred new American oak barrels, sourced from Kelvin Cooperage in Louisville, Kentucky. Malt, vanilla, and fudge on the nose, with ripe apples and lively oak. Toffee, caramel, vanilla, and cinnamon on the palate, while the finish is nutty, with notes of char.

87,Penderyn Legend,43,Welsh Whisky,50,"This madeira-finished whisky delivers a beautiful combination of crunchy red apple, dried apple rings, toasted oak, cubes of vanilla fudge, honey, and dabs of orange. It’s a friendly dram and it draws you in; attractive but not flashy or abundantly fragrant. Soft fruits, though not instantly sweet, accompanied by vegetal notes, almonds, and some spicy bitterness, with ginger, pepper, and clove encircling the tongue.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Amrut Single Malt,46,Indian Whisky,65,"Made from Indian barley, the nose is soft, fruity, and spicy. There’s cooked apples in crème anglaise, ripe apricot, sweet barley, nectarine, fresh mango, sticky cotton candy, and dry oak spices.

This should be your starting point for exploring Amrut’s whiskies.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Elijah Craig Small Batch,47,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"A solid, basic bourbon, with pure sweetness, honey, marzipan, and wildflower notes. The sweet drive is nicely backed with drying oak on the pronounced finish, like sucking on a sweet and woody cherry Popsicle stick. A simple and enjoyable crowd pleaser, and smaller sibling to the Barrel Proof, our <a href=""/top20/2017/1-elijah-craig-barrel-proof-b517/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">2017 Whisky of the Year</a>.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
87,Corsair Wildfire American Malt,50,Craft Whiskey,55,"Distilled from hickory-smoked malted barley. The nose leads with dark barbecue smoke, mulberry, orange peel, cedar chest, and winter campfire. Earl Grey tea, tobacco leaf, orange oil, and black pepper dominate the palate, along with a great deal of thick, heavy smoke. A lot of new wood character and slightly rough around the edges, but compelling. The sort of whiskey you’d find in a crumbling tower deep in the woods.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
87,FEW American,46.5,Craft Whiskey,50,"Laden with herbs and spices—mint, caraway, earthy ginger—on the nose, along with furniture polish and lemon. The palate is oak-driven and rich, full of dark chocolate, zippy caraway, roasted lemon, and ginger. There’s a pleasant fruitiness as well, but the finish is dry, all gentle spice and chocolate. Takes water well—in fact, a few drops helps to tame some of the punchy heat. A blend of bourbon, rye, and malt whiskeys.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
87,Clyde May’s Alabama Style,42.5,American Whiskey (Unspecified),36,"A host of sweet confections awaits in this whiskey, which appears to be Kentucky bourbon with some types of added flavoring. Big caramel gives way to angel food cake, crème brûlée, lemon chiffon, and batter. But it doesn’t stray far enough to resemble a flavored whiskey, delivering an oily texture and nice viscosity, oozing with apple, citrus, grape soda, and hints of leather. Not one for the purist, but enjoyable all the same.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
87,Basil Hayden’s Two by Two Rye,40,Rye Whiskey,45,"Bright, delicate, and approachable. While not a showstopper, it delivers generous sweet fruit, almost candied red apple sweetness, along with floral and black cherry notes. On the palate, it shows modest structure, with notes of lemon and pistachio, along with gentle wisps of baking spice and sandalwood. A blend of two Kentucky straight rye whiskeys and two Kentucky straight bourbons.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
87,Colkegan Single Malt,46,Craft Whiskey,55,"A dry smoke, led by brisket, dry oak, and cherries. Sweetly smoky in the mouth, with black pepper, cayenne, and barbecue flavors, as well as grilled fruits, nectarines, and charred plums. A good balance of sweet and spicy, with a backbone of minerality. The mesquite flavor amps up in the long and spicy finish.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
87,Jura Seven Wood,42,Single Malt Scotch,75,"Part of the Jura range exhibiting ‘sweetness and smoke.’ This was aged in first-fill American oak barrels and finished in six different types of French oak casks. Nutty on the nose, with freshly sawn wood, savory notes, and emerging ripe peaches. Very fruity on the palate, with tangerines, fudge, cinnamon, and toasted oak. Drying in the finish, with nutmeg.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
87,Tommyrotter Napa Valley Heritage Cask Bourbon,47.5,Craft Whiskey,70,"A bowl of sweet, fresh cherries greets you on the nose, the result of the Napa cabernet cask-finishing, and it melds well with notes of lemon zest, chocolate, and a hint of smoky charcoal. The palate delivers more cherry as well as strawberries, which combine with marshmallow and whipped cream, and the finish has plenty of length. It’s a bouquet of chocolate and berries, with impressive subtlety and complexity.",David Fleming,Fall 2018
87,Hamilton’s Islay,40,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,20,"Malt and seaweed drying around rock pools, this builds up a good head of dry, fibrous peat smoke, with sautéed mushrooms, chocolate nibs, and ozone. Sweet lemons and sugar mice on the palate, it slides into a creamy-smooth pool of milk chocolate, the smoke kicking in later on, dragging a layer of clove and pepper in its wake. Proof that an Islay experience need not break the bank.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Dancing Goat Limousin Rye,46,Craft Whiskey,45,"A Wisconsin rye aged in used American oak and new French oak, then finished in a Limousin oak solera. Heavily perfumed; incense and sandalwood on top of leather, gentle wood, and pleasingly soft rye spice. Golden raisins, white flowers, and violets on the palate, with a sweet and balanced finish. Softer and less assertive than traditional rye whiskeys, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
87,G. Rozelieures Origin Collection,40,French Whisky,40,"Hailing from the Lorraine region, this single malt is double distilled in Charentais pot stills. Orange flesh, lemon sherbet, strawberry bubble gum, candied fruit jellies, grapefruit, and dry spice, with shades of vanilla on the nose. To taste, a wishy-washy orange note with a thin structure hung with milk chocolate, mango juice, papaya, wood spice, and ground ginger, concluding in a pulped-fruit ending.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Samaroli ’S Peaty 2017,45,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,317,"Encompassing more than just Islay malts, the youngest liquid in this is from 1995. Malt loaf, peat barns, heavy salty smoke, hazelnut latte, roasted fennel seed, star anise, and sooty embers. This one could set the smoke alarms off. Good weight in the mouth, with pears in chocolate, clove, aniseed, vegetal notes, and deceptively less smoke until the powerfully intense finish of spice, soft fruit, cocoa, and seemingly eternal smoke.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
87,Four Roses,40,Bourbon/Tennessee,20,"Lovely cinnamon candies offer an entrancing first taste, with lemon drop and orange sherbet close behind. Baking spices come on strong mid-palate, with undertones of caramel and vanilla. But what makes this special is its mouthfeel: tingly and warming the palate throughout. Cinnamon is ever-present.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
87,Aberlour 12 year old,40,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. It offers a nose redolent of Christmas pudding: figs, sultanas, orange, honey, and cream.

87,BenRiach 10 year old Curiositas,46,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Introduced in 2004, Curiositas was the first peated expression to be marketed by BenRiach.

87,Glen Moray Elgin Classic,40,Single Malt Scotch,25,"This offers an enticing nose of honey, malt, and barley sugar—sweet and floral. Peaches in cream on the palate, a suggestion of madeira, milk chocolate, and Brazil nuts. Cocoa, citrus fruits, and light oak in the medium-length finish. <em>Value pick</em>",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
87,Collingwood Town Collection Double Barreled,45,Canadian,34,"The warehouses at Brown-Forman’s Canadian Mist Distillery in Collingwood, Ontario hold some rare beauties, including this one, the result of an experiment using a mashbill rather than processing the individual grains separately. Malty on the nose, with hard candies, Jujubes, and vague sour-mash bread notes. Palate is floral, gently perfumed, with sweet vanilla, mild peppers, barrel tones, and mildly pulling tannins. Long, pleasantly hot, cereal-rich finish. (Canada only) $44 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
87,Pearse Founder’s Choice 12 year old,42,Irish Single Malt,60,"Pearse Lyons Distillery opened in 2017, becoming Dublin’s second working distillery this century. This single malt has a nose of honey, apple pie with cream, light pepper, dried grasses, and green herbal notes. The orchard fruits of apple and pear are silenced by a fury of pepper, root ginger, and clove, with only grapefruit peel proffered in response. The dry, banana chip finish fades in a melee of squabbling spices. (KY, GA, and FL, with expansion planned)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
87,Miyagikyo Rum Wood Finish 2017,46,Japanese,465/set,"This gentler, naturally fruity whisky seems to benefit less from the rum than the peated Yoichi, the effect particularly heightened on the palate. A nose of warm muffins, fruit salad, faint citrus, the spiciness of fennel and pepper, with botanicals in a tropical palm house. Quite spicy, it evokes pepper and ginger, with pineapple, lemon wedges, lime, ripe melon, and some late maltiness. Cinnamon and peppery spice to finish. (3,500 bottles; sold as a set with Yoichi Rum Wood Finish 2017) €395/set",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
87,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Highland Park) 2003 14 year old,54.5,Single Malt Scotch,135,"The nose is muted, with gentle orchard fruits, subtle malt, nougat, and nutty toffee. The palate, by contrast, is bold and offers big fresh fruit notes, notably zesty tangerines, along with crème brûlée. Dry peat notes follow. Earthy peat smoke and white pepper with a citrus tang in the long finish. (230 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
87,Shelter Point Artisanal Single Malt,46,Canadian,66,"Distillery owner Patrick Evans grows much of the distillery’s barley on his 380-acre farm on the shores of British Columbia’s Straits of Georgia. In 2011 Evans and distiller James Marinus fired up the distillery’s two Forsyths copper pot stills. The resulting single malt is creamy, malty, and slightly minty. Citrus fruits, peach pits, and stimulating white pepper slowly fade into gentle barrel notes. (Canada only) $85 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
87,Lohin McKinnon Wine Barrel Finished,43,Canadian,47,"Single malt whisky from British Columbia-grown and malted barley, matured in bourbon barrels, then finished in wine barrels from Black Sage Vineyard in B.C.’s Okanagan Valley. Malted barley leaps from the glass along with a vague earthiness and mild fruits. Malty cereal on the palate, with vanilla, hot spices, milk chocolate, and purple grapes. The port-style wine influence is tastefully subtle. Finishes on dark fruits and milk chocolate. (Canada only) $60 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
87,Whiskey Del Bac Winter Release 2017,50,Craft Whiskey,60,"An intriguing nose of campfire smoke drapes the distinctive aroma of mesquite charcoal, dark toast with honey, and pretty floral notes. On the palate, the blast of initial sweetness gets swept up in burnt matchsticks, peppery heat, and wood tannins. A bit hot on the finish. This is a big, in-your-face, meaty whiskey that any barbecue brisket fan will relish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
87,Redemption,42,Bourbon/Tennessee,29,"Initially, floral and fruit meet oak and a cadre of baking spices. Then it’s a plethora of vanilla in several forms, from icing to pudding, followed by notes of butterscotch, fudge, Oreo cookies, and pecan shell. Sweet cigar tobacco and honey follow this home to a short to medium finish with a hint of peach cobbler. Ideal for cocktails.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
87,Redemption High Rye,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,29,"Sweet and smoke open this interesting whiskey that bounces from sweet to savory throughout. Vanilla and caramel meet burnt oak and charcoal smoke, followed by cinnamon, nutmeg, and a lot of coffee. Hazelnut and salt water taffy jump in for a quick note just before a medium finish with a hint of smoke.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
87,Redwood Empire American Whiskey,45,American Blended Whiskey,45,"A blend of 11, 5, and 4 year old bourbons blended with 2 and 3 year old ryes. Pine, cedar, and cigar box offer a pleasant botanical and masculine nose that has slight hints of dill and roasted corn. It’s bright and extremely interesting, with notes of Mexican chocolate, strawberry and orange Marmajam, rye toast, and peanut butter. The medium finish offers a hint of wintergreen",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
87,John L. Sullivan,40,Irish Blended Whiskey,26,"Drink to the Boston Strong Boy, the last bare-knuckle boxing heavyweight champion of the world. The nose is bright: apple, pear, vanilla pod, lime zest, orange peel, puffy marshmallow, and light toffee. As the gloves come off, the palate rolls with the punches of malt, apple, vanilla, and spearmint, parrying jabs of brown sugar, caramel, and stroopwafels. It’s light on its feet and delivers nutty, spicy finishing moves.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
87,The Balvenie 1993 23 year old,51.9,Single Malt Scotch,"60,000/set","This was aged in a refill American oak hogshead, as was the 1981 expression. Like that variant, it has pineapple and lemon on the nose and also yields milk chocolate, green apples, and fresh-sawn wood. Smooth, full, and sweet on the palate, again with very ripe tropical fruits, plus apple pie. The finish is medium in length; quite austere.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
87,Highland Park Full Volume,47.2,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Full Volume is a U.S.-exclusive bottling that was distilled in 1999 and matured entirely in first-fill bourbon casks. The nose is fragrant, with canned pears and vanilla ice cream, coconut, and a very subtle wisp of smoke. Quite thin on the palate, nutty, mildly herbal, with tropical fruits. Ashy peat smoke, cocoa powder, and wood spice in the medium-length finish.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
87,Balcones Texas Blue Corn Bourbon (Batch BCB17-1),64.6,Craft Whiskey,80,"The concentration here is impressive, as dates and raisins meet leathery oak that smells of a dusty tack shop, joined by some lovely cinnamon, clove, and spearmint. The intensity on the rich palate is face-melting, hot, and muscular. Sweet flan, caramel corn, and vivid spice succumb to a finish built for oak lovers, drying and a bit tannic, bringing the molten sweet flavors to an end too soon.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
87,St. George Single Malt Lot 17,43,Craft Whiskey,100,"Exhibits the floral, rose petal, and fresh meadow character often found in St. George malts. The palate pours with white peach and apricot, coupled with warm cereal notes. A delicate whiskey that might have benefited from higher proof, but remains enjoyable for its lingering sweetness, elegant character, and unmistakable craftsmanship.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
87,Westward American Single Malt,45,Craft Whiskey,80,"A true American single malt; the impression of new charred barrels distinguishes this from its Old World counterparts, while the creamed honey, caramel, and candied nuts keep the wood in check. On the palate, the wood influence delivers big vanilla and hints of smoky char, coupled with nicely concentrated flavors of Turkey Golden table syrup, fruit, and spice. A nice rendition of New World single malt, showing proof and gusto.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
87,Bone Snapper X-Ray Straight Rye 4 year old (Batch 1),55,Rye Whiskey,50,"At first, fruit and charred oak own the moment, only to be interrupted by petrol, florals, and earth. Spice sets in with an abundance of sweetness following. Then, a lovely explosion of fresh-baked rye rolls with hints of pomegranate, orange peel, banana, and apple. Pepper spices remain to the end where a medium finish, with hints of cinnamon await.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
87,Remus Repeal Reserve Series I,47,Bourbon/Tennessee,75,"Starting with floral, fruit, and perfume notes, its prominent bouquet barely allows the undertones of honeysuckle, spice, and oak to shine through. On the palate, honey, canned peaches, tobacco, and crème brûlée lead the way just before an explosion of vanilla layers the palate in the form of cake batter, icing, and a white fudge-dipped Oreo. However, bitterness sets in, causing a slight unbalance and lingers toward the medium finish.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
87, Uncle Nearest 1856,50,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"Slow-roasted corn, marzipan, cinnamon, nutmeg, and kettle corn start this experience and slowly fade to corn on the cob with butter, salt, and pepper. Then, it’s apple cider vinegar, deep-fried mushrooms, and Nutella. Fried pie dough and hints of chocolate appear before a medium finish that has a hint of toffee.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
87,Tincup 10 year old,42,Craft Whiskey,55,"Pretty violet and floral notes lead the way, with herb garden and chocolaty oak draped over caramel chews. The creamy palate offers marshmallow and a candy store mélange of Jolly Ranchers and Swedish Fish, before the finely balanced oak comes in, meeting the sweetness with sandalwood and rye spice. A lovely effort that places balance above sheer power.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
87,The Temple Bar Signature Blend,40,Blended Irish Whiskey,40,"This blend is full of bold flavors: sweet barley, oranges and lemons, fudge, and pastel-colored macaroons. There is plenty of body, with vanilla, brown sugar, strands of citrus, fudge, and spice. It seems slow to warm up, the flavors a little lost for a few seconds before it gets its act together. Lengthy finish of buzzy spices, lemon peel, and caramelized brown sugar.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
87,Kurayoshi 8 year old,46,Japanese,80,"Heady with spring blossoms, mixed peel, cantaloupe, green banana, and taffy candy, with a fine thread of spices running through it. A hesitant opening, it wallows in gentle apple and orange before a strong tangerine streak appears, the mouthfeel becoming weightier, drawing through flavors of peppery herbal salad leaves and vanilla cream. The spices take the lead from then on, the fruit fading quickly in the peppery afterglow. (1,440 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
87,Kurayoshi Sherry Cask 8 year old,46,Japanese,100,"Age adds a richer, creamier note suggestive of lighter styles of sherry, more fino or manzanilla, perhaps a cream sherry. The fruit note is more rounded, the nutmeg, clove, and pepper deliver a stronger kick. Ripe yellow fruits with melon and apple, not too sweet, followed by a sharper edge of light sherry. By comparison, the younger whisky has more fruit to balance out the nippy spices. (720 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
87,Reisetbauer 12 year old,48,Austrian Whisky,131,"Peppermint cream, menthol, whole plum, cranberry, and very delicate toasted-wood spices. The palate has cooked apple, Fruit Pastilles, plum flesh, malt, drinking chocolate, and brown sugar. As time progresses, it develops a slight sourness, with the spices spreading out wide under the tongue. The final phase conjures up a char note, black tea, and burnt sultana bread, leading to a finish of spices and dulled stewed fruit.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
87,William Wolf Rye,46,Netherlands Whisky,35,"This 100% rye has a beautifully developed nose of roasted coriander seed, white pepper, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch, though the spices dominate and impede other characteristics from shining through. The initial mandarin and tropical-fruit sweetness is left behind as the peppery spices roar away. The finish sees the spices vanish into thin air, as if teleported back to the mother ship. Ideal for rye-based cocktails.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
87,Mt. Logan 15 year old,40,Canadian,35,"Rather than complexity, this all-corn whisky showcases softness and a rich creamy mouthfeel—even if it does meet the Canadian definition of rye whisky. Peppery spices with a keen bite come from the barrel, not grain. Berries and corncobs add depth to fruit cocktail, with sharp spices balancing a lush waxiness. Its syrupy feel evolves into kiwi fruit flavors and tartness on the finish. ($45CAD; Canada only)",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2018
87,Lost Spirits Abomination The Sayers of the Law,54,Miscellaneous,50,"Aromas of smoked meat, kelp, saline, rubber, and butterscotch pudding make for a sweet and savory first impression. Flavors of burnt sugar, vanilla custard, cooked apple, dark cacao, black pepper, and salty umami carry through on a big, aggressive, hunger-sparking palate. The finish is unsweetened chocolate, ash, and pepper—bold and unapologetic, it responds well to water.

Actual Time in Barrel: 18 months;

Processing: Multiple peated malt distillates are aged in Scotland, then blended, exported, and put through Lost Spirits’ reactor with pieces of charred oak treated with Riesling wine.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2018
87,Connemara Original,40,Irish,55,"Exudes beautiful soft peat notes, barley sugar, and apple-cinnamon granola. Light lemon and honey, with a delightful growth in apple crumble flavors, golden syrup, and more peat smoke and orchard fruits on the finish. Drink this neat.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Johnnie Walker Blender’s Batch Wine Cask,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,30,"Blender Aimée Gibson set out to make a sundowner scotch by incorporating whiskies matured in wine casks. The blueberry, blackcurrant, and fresh oak aromas continue on to the palate: fruit compote, raspberry, strawberry, and lingonberry with light spices. A late resurgence of dark toffee, chocolate, and cigar smoke blow into the finish. Sip away by all means, but this fruity sensation calls to be served up in long, cool drinks.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Benromach Organic 2017 (distilled 2010),43,Single Malt Scotch,70,"The latest version of the first certified organic Scotch whisky is a creamy malt that has lashings of vanilla, banana peel, and pecan pie aromas. Smooth, malty flavors abound. Banoffee pie topped with sliced banana, apple, nectarine, and ripe peach, with a good flare of peppery spices. Fuzzy, earthy spice, then an outro of sweet fudge. With water, more green fruit, melon, tropical fruits, and a little chili kick emerge.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Highland Park Magnus,40,Single Malt Scotch,40,"Named for Highland Park Distillery’s founder, Magnus Eunson. It has been matured in first-fill and refill American oak sherry casks. The nose offers honeysuckle, vanilla, rising bread dough, and faint, aromatic wood smoke. Slightly smoky orchard fruits on the early palate, with sultanas, ripe cherries, and cinnamon. Medium to long in the finish, with drying fruit notes, wood spice, and ultimately, licorice sticks. (<i>U.S. exclusive</i>)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
87,Wemyss Family Collection Treacle Chest,46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,62,"The new Wemyss Family Collection includes two blended malts; this is the better of the pair. Raisin, date, fruitcake, stewed apple and plum, cumin, coriander, allspice, and new leather leave little mystery about the role played by the sherry hogshead. Gingerbread, plum, and dark orange draw the mouth. Fruity sweetness, but never sugary; there are jam tarts, walnut, and minimal interference from the spices until the dry finish. (6,300 bottles) £47",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Cedar Ridge Iowa Bourbon,40,Craft Whiskey,49,"This light-hued bourbon is bright and airy, with tropical fruit aromas of papaya and lychee, vanilla, and sweet lemon curd. While not especially bourbon-like it’s interesting and super-likeable for its Bit-O-Honey candy and pleasingly nutty notes. Last reviewed in 2011.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
87,Ohishi Sherry Cask,42.3,Japanese,75,"This has the warming comfort of cask strength rice pudding, with just enough rice character peeking through the sherry. Marzipan, sultana, fig, and toasted spice. Nutty <i>amontillado</i> notes load up on dried fruits, including apricot, mango, and apples pricked with cloves. The late phase includes black cherry, old leather, cola-flavored candy, and burnt fruitcake. A quick fizzle of spice and dried fig turns slightly savory.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Grangestone 12 year old Highland single malt,40,Single Malt Scotch,33,"The nose is inviting, with marzipan, malt, ripe bananas, milk chocolate, and cinnamon. Green fruit notes emerge later. Very sweet on the smooth palate, with bubble gum, satsumas, peaches, and delicate spice. The finish is medium to long and persistently sweet and fruity, with a hint of dark chocolate at the end. Sure to satisfy a sweet tooth.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
87,Rock Oyster 18 year old,46.8,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,116,"Peat smoke dominates the nose of salt crystals, green tea, pine cones, peppermint creams, and charcoal. The tasty palate has sweet fudge, heather honey, and mandarin, which balance out the ginger and light pepper spiciness. Smoke catches in the throat as it becomes fruitier in the later stages. Finish is hot, drying, with smoke and ginger spices. Decent enough, though its appeal will skew toward peat lovers.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
87,Clonakilty,43.6,Irish Blended Whiskey,50,"Ahead of the distillery opening, Michael Scully is working on a series of Clonakilty releases in the warehouse. His promising first release is bourbon cask matured, with a nose of raspberry, strawberry taffy, roasted coriander seed, star anise, apple, green fruits, and smoldering cooperage oak. The palate brings mandarin, light honey, sweet oak, creamy vanilla, fresh banana, peppercorns, and custard. Vanilla sweetness and a welcome spicy buzz to finish. (3,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
88,Woodford Reserve Baccarat Edition,45.2,Bourbon/Tennessee,"1,500","The nose is unorthodox, but not unpleasant. Herbal, with notes of dill and potpourri, with licorice, figs, coconut, and brown sugar following. The palate comes into focus with traditional flavors of fragrant vanilla, marshmallow, and bubble gum, as well as coconut, chocolate-covered almonds, popcorn, and pepper spice. The finish is lengthy, presenting baking spice, cracked pepper, and polished oak. Unusual in profile, but combining bitter herbal notes with very traditional flavors.",David Fleming,Fall 2019
88,Balvenie 14 year old The Week of Peat,48.3,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Made from the same recipe as previous Peat Week bottlings, with the name referring to the one week per year Balvenie distills peated whisky. Stone fruits lightly smoked in a peat kiln on the early nose, new leather, and honey. Sweet peat smoke, orchard fruits, and soft spices on the palate. The fruits darken in the finish, with licorice and spicy oak. (18,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019

Bold tropical fruits on the palate, with toffee, red berries, and more soft woodsmoke. The medium-length finish highlights licorice and drying oak.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
88,Macallan Estate,43,Single Malt Scotch,250,"Distilled with a portion of barley grown on the distillery’s Easter Elchies estate. The nose detects quite intense sherry, plus black forest cake, then warm leather and fresh-squeezed orange juice. Full sherry notes on the palate, with new leather, marzipan, cherry liqueur, furniture polish, and dark chocolate. The finish yields bitter chocolate, licorice, nutmeg, and tingling wood spices.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
88,Springbank 10 year old,46,Single Malt Scotch,72,"Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. A whiff of brine on the early nose, with damp earth, citrus fruit, cereal, and mildly smoky oak. The palate is supple and offers vanilla toffee, cedarwood, hazelnuts, and more brine. A spicy finish yields coconut and a hint of dry peat.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
88,Tamdhu 12 year old,43,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Relatively dry on the nose, with citrus fruit, hazelnut, and quite dry sherry. The palate is full and rich, with sweeter sherry notes, cinnamon, and banoffee pie. Jaffa oranges, hot chocolate, and slightly tannic oak in the medium-length finish. Matured in oloroso casks.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
88,Oban 14 year old,43,Single Malt Scotch,75,"The nose is floral, with honey, toffee, cereal, and a hint of smoke, but subtle maritime notes are also present. The palate is rich and relatively complex: spicy, with citrus fruit, more cereal, seaweed, peat smoke, and oak. Lengthy in the finish, with toffee, new leather, and perpetual spice. A long-standing favorite with a very distinctive profile.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
88,High West Yippee Ki-Yay (Batch 19C27),46,Rye Whiskey,80,"This blend of straight ryes finished in vermouth and syrah barrels now includes some of High West’s own whiskey, distilled in Utah. The nose is fresh and herbal, with spearmint, tarragon, dill pickle, fresh celery juice, and a candied note of orange Kool-Aid. Fruit, nut, and spice flavors temper some of the wild herbaceousness of the palate: blueberry jam, peanuts, cinnamon, and dark chocolate. Lengthy finish, with more dark fruit, nuts, spice, and oak.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019
88,Penderyn Madeira Finish Single Malt,46,Welsh Whisky,70,"This nugget of Welsh gold has a nose of candied orange and lemon slices, toasted spices, herb garden, light vanilla, and the oils of finely shredded peel. On the palate, there’s toffee and orange cake, an array of tropical fruits with papaya and passion fruit sweetness, and a good thrust of pepper and clove, leaving just a hint of grated chocolate and cask char in a dry finish.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
88,Cutty Sark,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,20,"Sherbet, creamy vanilla, whole lemon, fresh baked goods, sweet grain notes, strong floral blooms, with hints of snuff and ground pepper on the nose. Light, delicate palate of lemon flesh; the citrus sharpens up, with grapefruit flavors supported by fine ground pepper and a lasting wave of vanilla. A pleasing tingle of spices on the finish, coupled with punchy citrus notes. A nimble, vigorous blend that offers a multitude of serves. <em>Best Values</em>",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
88,Port Askaig 10th Anniversary,55.85,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Lemon juice, tide pools, roasted pork, and peat embers mingle on the nose. Smoky toffee in time. Canned peach slices in syrup over woodsmoke on the palate; buttery smoked fish, lots of energetic spices. The finish is fruity, with aniseed and lingering spices.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2019
88,WhistlePig PiggyBack 6 year old,48.28,Rye Whiskey,50,"A lively nose with scents of orange peel, wild strawberries, pepper spice, and herbal tea. The palate presents a balanced offering of cream, orange Creamsicle, and bitter chocolate, all overlaid with a ring of white pepper.

88,Bulleit 12 year old Straight Rye,46,Rye Whiskey,50,"Time in the barrel is apparent here, with ample cedar, sawdust, and toasty oak sprinkled across caramel sweetness with a medley of herbal flavors, including licorice and basil.

88,Deerhammer Port Cask-Finished American Single Malt (Batch 1),50,Single Malt American Whiskey,65,"An herbaceous and savory whiskey, with an expressive nose: fennel, licorice, roasted lemon and clementine peels, new leather, and dark berries.

88,Bone Snapper X-Ray 4 year old Reserve Straight Rye (Batch 2),55,Rye Whiskey,55,"This pours punchy, vivid, and somewhat youthful with sparks of white pepper, cereal grain aromas, and an impression of menthol and alpine herbs.

88,Roe & Co,45,Blended Irish Whiskey,35,"Ahead of Diageo’s new Irish distillery opening in Dublin, this release has a bouquet of grilled orange, barley sugar, Conference pear, and vanilla cream laced with white pepper. The warm, fruity palate with soft barley sugars, poached pear, moderate spices, and tangy citrus becomes increasingly sweet, with vanilla dominating proceedings in the later phase. Easy to like, this makes me want to experiment and start mixing it up.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
88,Griffo Stony Point (Batch 9),47,American Whiskey (Unspecified),49,"Made with corn and rye and aged in new American and French oak barrels. It’s appetizing on the nose, with aromas of almond scone spread with orange marmalade, along with cooked pumpkin and butterscotch pudding.

88,Eau Claire Ploughman’s Rye,43,Canadian,55,"From rye grown in a single Alberta field, cultivated and harvested using horse-drawn farm machinery, this whisky was aged in new American oak, then finished in the distillery’s single malt barrels. The nose is dry, clean, and herbal: slatey, with hints of cereal. Quite sweet on the palate, with peaches, berries, kiwi, and exotic fruits.

88,Jameson Caskmates Captain Lawrence Brewing Co. Edition,40,Irish Blended Whiskey,30,"Spicier and funkier than other Caskmates, this is where Irish whiskey meets Scott Vaccaro’s brews from the Lower Hudson Valley. This is self-assured with dark ale aromas, cinnamon bark, grapefruit, bitter lemon, and some savory notes. The pot still spices work overtime, complementing the dark honey, apple, and creamy beer notes. It feels a little out of focus, with pulses of flavor rather than a smooth development.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
88,Eagle Rare 10 year old Straight,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Sweet candy shop, nougat, and honeycomb flavors are underscored by some funky earth and mushroom notes. The palate is sweet and lively, delivering orange peel and subtle hints of baking spice. Overall a pleasant pour, with the only criticism that it feels rather light-bodied, with the oak a bit sharp.

On the palate, the grain is evident, but so too is drying oak, orange, cinnamon, and chocolate.

88,Balvenie 2009 vintage,64.6,Single Malt Scotch,661,"This was aged in new American oak and selected for its faint smokiness, believed to have been picked up from a previous peated spirit run.

88,Big Peat Christmas Edition 2018,53.9,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,75,"Windswept and coastal: rock pools, the chalky sweetness of Edinburgh rock candy, and aromas of smoked fish on the quayside. The masochism of bonfire smoke and peat reek is utterly invigorating and restorative. Lemon creaminess, with an eruption of spice and citrus, the irascible spices pushing out in all directions.

Vanilla, lemon, cream, and shortbread, this puffs out beautifully with a tug of pepper, always in balance, before relaxing into lemon meringue pie territory, with those sweet lemons persisting into the finish.

88,Navazos Palazzi Spanish Grain,53.5,Spanish Whisky,120,"A sultry, earthy, fragrant whisky, with black cherry, currants, dunnage warehouses, sherry, ground ginger, dry oak, and chili flakes. Warm and enticing, this displays great structure: black cherry, sultana, and dried fig; a middle phase of cavorting spices that are soothed into a lengthy finish of spicy, rich dried fruits. Plenty of sherry character makes this a delicious find, but it would be interesting to try a less cask-driven expression. (900 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019

88,Spirit Works Bottled in Bond Straight Rye,50,Rye Whiskey,60,"Rye at its prettiest and most delicate: bouquets of flowers, with boxed pistachio pudding, Apple Jacks, honey cough drops, licorice, and anise on the nose.

88,Starward Nova,41,Australian Whisky,55,"Braided apple puff pastry, sultana, custard, a hint of blueberry, and jam slathered over warm scones, backed by hot chocolate and Christmas spices.

88,Sagamore Spirit Port Finish Rye,50.5,Rye Whiskey,70,"Rose petal and grapefruit meet clove-like spice, but it’s the soapy floral sachet and dill notes that distinguish this rye.

88,Fukano Vault Reserve #1,40.5,Japanese,90,"Herbal with roasted sage leaves, coriander seed, savory meat juices, and a twinge of tarragon, though there are fruity qualities like fresh peach and clementine.

Rich oak and red wine on the nose lead to exotic spices, tingling peppers, burley tobacco, and vaguely phenolic grape skins on a buttery palate.

88,Compass Box The Story of the Spaniard,43,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,65,"Nobody was expecting this Spanish proposition, as the inquisitive John Glaser adds the first new permanent addition to the range in many years.

Farmyard aromas, with oak and dark chocolate. Very smooth and supple on the palate, with orange marmalade, raisins, and old oak. The finish is quite short, with dried fruit and milky coffee. (160 bottles for U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
88,Berry Bros & Rudd The Classic Range Sherry Cask Matured,44.2,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,41,"This is rich in cask characters, with baked orange, pronounced nutmeg notes, mace, peppercorn, and petrichor. The opening flavors of dark orange and syrupy caramel swerve headlong into pepper, root ginger, allspice, and nippy clove. Despite appearances, this is not awash with sherry-dominated fruitiness, but the finish is long, with spice-led dried fruits. £32",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Glendalough Triple Barrel,42,Irish,55,"Three is the magic number: bourbon, oloroso, and canteiro-seasoned madeira barrels bring forth an intense whiskey that radiates summer warmth with unctuous raisin sweetness, candied orange peel, honey, ground cumin, peppercorn, and toasted oak. Peppercorn and oak char follow fruity-sweet flavors of apple, cranberry, cherry, and sultana. This impressive grain whiskey is more assertively spicy than their malts, but displays even greater depth and character than Glendalough Double Barrel. €48",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Vicomte Cask Strength,67.8,French Whisky,60,"One for the fruit fiends: honeyed apricots, tart kumquats, candied pineapple, dried kiwi, and layered spices—ginger, cardamom, licorice—on the nose. More candied fruit, grape soda, bubble gum, dried apricot, and kiwi flood the palate, along with licorice and earthy spice on the finish. Add water liberally—the high proof conceals some of the most entrancing flavors.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
88,Woodinville Straight 100% Rye,45,Craft Whiskey,42,"Peach, blueberry, candied raspberry, and lime lead the way, with marzipan and a background of peppery spice aromas set artfully against soft, subtle wood. A mouth-filling palate offers lemon and raspberry, along with ginger, cinnamon, chocolate, and honey. Water coaxes tropical notes of melon and pineapple. The finish is peppery, with caramel and chocolate flowing over pleasant oak overtones. A rye that strikes an excellent balance between fruit, sweetness, and spice.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
88,Woodinville Straight Bourbon,45,Craft Whiskey,40,"Black pepper and toasted oak on the nose mingle with deeper aromas of blackcurrant and strawberry preserves. The palate is smooth, showing flavors of vanilla bean, coconut, peppermint, and cinnamon. Dark chocolate emerges on the back palate, along with pepper and tobacco leaf. The finish is long, revealing maple syrup, caramel, and brown sugar. Five years of aging have created a solid, well-constructed bourbon that has impressive depth and complexity.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
88,Domaine Hautes Glaces Les Moissons,41.7,French Whisky,95,"Bright, fresh, fruity, and clean, with a nose of fresh cream, pressed flowers, ripening green melon, green apple, and cut pear, mellowing into baked fruit tarts, rubbed lemon peel, and spice. It’s a very sweet mouthful of sugary candy, vanilla fudge, lemon bonbon, sherbet, and fermenting apple laced with a few tangy strands of citrus. A long-lasting sweet finish, with lemon and an initial spicy buzz. €84",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Bellevoye Blue,40,French Whisky,35,"A well-developed nose of rich toffee, blackcurrant, red apple, and beeswax, which incorporates a mild layer of spice. Mandarin orange shines through, quite a fleshy texture overall, with chocolate buttons, and pepper and clove stepping in from the wings; the clove and a bitter note eventually taking center stage. The flavor development, complexity, and spices are laudable, and the texture and weight are distinctively different.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Bellevoye White,40,French Whisky,45,"A blend of three malts with a finish in sauternes barrels; the sweet wine gracing the whisky with a light, delicate frame. It takes a while to open up, unfurling flavors of brioche, egg custard, walnut baklava, ground cumin, and a conspicuous vanilla scent. Cinnamon commands the palate, supported by peach, nectarine, and vanilla, with a nuttiness and base notes of spice, rounding off with cinnamon, pepper, and baked orange.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
88,Balnellan 12 year old Speyside Glenlivet,40,Single Malt Scotch,33,"Enjoy fresh aromas in multiple ways, like fruit (melon, pear, blueberry) and a sea breeze (oyster shell, salty). Full flavors of tangerine, Bosc pear, salted pistachio, white pepper, dried ginger, and mint are diminished only by the light body. The finish is particularly satisfying, but a little more heft would make it shine. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
88,Hickory Hill 12 year old Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Bourbon (Barrel No. 2),45,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"Aromas of peanuts, sassafras, Cheerwine soda, nutty oak, and a sweep of cloves, allspice, and ginger, sprinkled with blackberries and cherries. There’s zippy citrus on the palate, a nice lift of heavier oak, roasted nut, dark chocolate, and baking spice flavors. But the richness stops short on the finish, which is light and quick. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
88,Olde Point 4 year old,40,Canadian,15,"Dessert is served. Blueberries and raspberries baked into a sweet pie crust, with pistachio, spiced almonds, and marzipan on the nose. The palate has gentle spice and a heft of deeper flavors—caramel, semi-sweet chocolate, candied berries and almonds, and orange gummy wedges—balanced by vanilla and coconut. Though light, it finishes with a satisfying richness of berry candy and polished oak. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
88,Crown Royal Deluxe,40,Canadian,25,"Although grain changes every year due to the weather, the flavor of Crown Royal Deluxe remains consistent. The skilled blenders who make this entry-level Crown Royal use their finely tuned noses, not a recipe, to ensure this. Wood, orchard fruits, floral tones, and gallons of vanilla on the nose translate into butterscotch, peppery rye spices, and creamy vanilla fudge on the palate.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2018
88,Evan Williams Single Barrel 2009 Vintage,43.3,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Floral and minty on the nose, with dusty cedar chest and earth over red and yellow apple. The palate offers a decent concentration of flavors, with citrus oil, apricot, and mouthwatering juiciness. It’s nicely layered and well-balanced, but short on the finish. This whiskey has ranged widely over the years, and as a single barrel selection your experience may vary.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
88,Four Roses Small Batch,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,35,"Oak-driven nose, where dusty oak floorboard meets light brown sugar and some herbal notes. On the palate this delivers tropical fruits, with hints of banana and papaya, and features a nice slick mouthfeel that succumbs to drying tannins, ending with nutty qualities and earthy forest floor. Simple and easy to enjoy.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
88,Balvenie DoubleWood 12 year old,43,Single Malt Scotch,55,"This ever-popular expression of Balvenie is matured for roughly 12 years in ex-bourbon casks and finished for 9 months in Spanish oak oloroso sherry casks. Floral on the nose, with honey, oak, and almonds. Spicy sherry, nutmeg, and dried fruit on the silky palate. Quite long in the finish, with a hint of orange, plus drying spices. Elegant, yet robust.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
88,Glenfiddich 18 year old Small Batch Reserve,40,Single Malt Scotch,110,"This was aged in a mixture of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks, followed by a final spell of marrying in wooden tuns. Dried fruits, dark chocolate, figs, and cinnamon on the nose. The palate yields rich caramel and toffee-apple notes, plus ginger, cloves, and medium sherry. More dried fruits, cookies, and a sprinkling of allspice in the slightly smoky, medium to long finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
88,Old Pulteney Clipper,46,Single Malt Scotch,55,"This limited-edition bottling was matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. It is non-chill filtered and includes no caramel coloring. Vanilla, milk chocolate, dried fruits, and green apples on the nose. Relatively light-bodied, with orange juice, honey, wood spice, and a hint of brine on the soft, oaky palate. The finish is medium in length, gently fruity, with mixed nuts and salted caramel.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
88,Penderyn Myth,43,Welsh Whisky,60,"Fresh fruits, satsuma peel, lime zest, pear, lemon meringue pie, and a cheeky burst of spices in this red wine and American oak bourbon barrel-finished whisky. Marshmallow softness, with apple, cooked Jell-O, and cherry slam into fruit-skin bitterness, chicory root, and aniseed, descending into spicy bitter fruit flavors. This perks the palate up no end. Oak seems to hold stronger cards than the wine soaked into the staves.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
88,Port Askaig 8 year old,45.8,Single Malt Scotch,65,"This addition to the Port Askaig range is presented with natural color, without chill filtration, and matured in refill American oak casks. The nose presents light peat, ozone, and faint medicinal notes, becoming saltier and spicier with time. Bracing. Woodsmoke, kippers, grapefruit, and lime on the palate. The finish is sweet, with receding smoke.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
88,Speyburn 15 year old,46,Single Malt Scotch,65,"A mix of American and Spanish oak casks was used to mature this addition to the core range. A big blast of orchard and tropical fruits characterizes the early nose, along with honey, vanilla, and toffee. The palate also majors in fruit, this time principally oranges, plus caramel, cinnamon, milk chocolate, and lots of vanilla. The finish is quite short, with banana and ginger.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
88,Balcones Brimstone,53,Craft Whiskey,60,"Distilled from roasted blue corn. The spirit itself, not the grain, is smoked over Texas scrub oak. Spicy Red Vines, herbal notes, and blackened corn aromas. An initial burst of fire on the palate transforms into juicy red fruit, sweet cinnamon apple, and hints of bramble and forest floor. An unusual and polarizing whiskey, Brimstone is aggressive at first, but in the end it’s a gentle giant.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
88,Big Peat Fèis Ìle 2018,48,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,65,"Well-balanced offering of sweet citrus, grapefruit peel, and beach bonfire smoke. Cream, lemon, and lime zest are overcome by smoke as the chili spice and pepper go off like a rocket. More disciplined, it settles down to sweet orange, lemon bonbon, cocoa, and driftwood smoke. An incredibly pale whisky, it’s punchy, but not overly complex, although it does include some fun stickers to let you customize your own bottle. (3,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
88,Berry Bros & Rudd The Classic Range Islay Blended Malt,44.2,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,42,"One of four new affordable blended malts in the range, this delivers a direct line of clean, pure smoke; richly peaty, with shrimp shells, salty sea spray, fresh citrus peel, vanilla, and the aroma of fine cigar smoke. There’s an elegant purity to the nose. The palate takes a different course, with tangy, sharp citrus, bitter orange, herbal notes, lemon sherbet, shortbread, and jagged spices. Quite a stallion. £32",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
88,Jura 18 year old,44,Single Malt Scotch,125,"Jura has introduced a new house style of ‘sweetness and smoke,’ and this spent 18 years in bourbon barrels, with a finish in red wine casks. Malt, peach blossom, raspberries, vanilla, and dark chocolate on the nose. The palate offers red berries, more chocolate, cloves, and peat. Dry red wine notes in the finish, with fruity spices and black pepper.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
88,The Chita,43,Japanese,34,"Suntory built Chita Distillery in 1972 to produce a diverse range of corn-based grain whisky styles. This single grain has bright, floral aromas with light honey, orange and lemon peel, freshly unwrapped bubble gum, rose water, and an edge of spice. Clean, pure, and moreish, this high-quality whisky showcases lychee, citrus, banana, and honey, with herbal fringes and a juicy finish. Oh, and it’s terrific on the rocks. JP¥3,800",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
88,Whiskey Del Bac Dorado,45,Craft Whiskey,56,"Mesquite-smoked single malt from Arizona. Very rich and aromatic, dripping with barbecue sauce, paprika, juicy red apple, and smoked bacon on the nose. A full panoply of barbecue flavors on the palate—brisket, roast chicken, ribs. Cayenne, walnuts, and spiced ginger balanced with oranges, apples, and pears. Some tar and creosote notes. Juicy, meaty, and smoky all at the same time. The herbal, vegetative notes are intriguing, but can be divisive.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
88,Breuckelen Project No. 1 Bottled in Bond Wheated Bourbon,50,Craft Whiskey,80,"The nose begins with notes of cinnamon, soft oak, cardamom, white pepper, and a hint of new wood. The palate shifts to a subtle blend of orange and vanilla. Water reveals fresh raspberry, along with notes of fresh herbs, roasted almonds, tobacco leaf, and more new wood. The finish is powerful and complex, leading with vanilla and more nuttiness, as well as red fruit and roasted pineapple.",David Fleming,Fall 2018
88,Samaroli by Samaroli 2017 Edition,43,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,176,"A smart little 8 year old blended malt with notes of light vanilla, hay bales, fresh flowers, and orange-flavored candies. Light, clean, and easy to like. The palate majors in orange flavors, first orange juice, with crunchy biscuit, gingerbread, and fizzy sherbet in the middle. It’s packed with flavor and depth, and ends with orange lollipops. The tanginess ricochets around the mouth, leaving a deep glow of citrus.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
88,Compass Box Hedonism,43,Blended Grain Scotch Whisky,115,"Oat flapjacks, golden syrup, beautiful dry-roasted spice notes, vanilla essence, cornbread, creamed coconut, and flashes of mango and apple. A luxuriant feast of sweet vanilla, soft warm bread, whipped cream, caramel, a little tug of spice, with a late ripple of grain flavors. Caramel, spice, and grain notes mark the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
88,Buffalo Trace,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Effervescent, tingly mouthfeel, but the flavor begins after the initial warmth, with hints of caramel apple, pumpkin pie, apricot, and a slight hint of caramel popcorn. Then it’s pumice, apricot, and marmalade, followed by salt water taffy, cinnamon, and a big burst of nutmeg. A long finish offers a hint of peach pie.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
88,Aberlour 16 year old,40,Single Malt Scotch,80,"Both bourbon and sherry casks were used for aging. Stewed fruits, butterscotch, and soft spices on the nose.

88,Glenglassaugh Peated Port Wood Finish,46,Single Malt Scotch,81,"Glenglassaugh has launched its first cask-finished whiskies, matured for an unspecified period in first- fill American oak casks before finishing for up to 2 years in secondary casks. This is the pick of the quartet of expressions, with a nose of fragrant, fruity smoke, hand-rolling tobacco, and new leather. Red berry fruits and woodsmoke feature on the palate, while the finish offers gentle peat smoke, cinnamon, and black pepper. £60",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
88,Glenmorangie Cadboll,43,Single Malt Scotch,115,"Part of Glenmorangie’s Legends collection, this was finished in casks that previously held sweet French white wines. Sweet red berries on the somewhat shy nose, with developing low-key honey and vanilla. Nicely textured, with a palate of honey, caramel, milk chocolate, shortbread, and lots of lively spice. Lengthy in the finish, with more caramel and milk chocolate, plus strawberry and ginger. (Travel Retail exclusive) £85",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
88,The Macallan Classic Cut (2017 Edition),58.4,Single Malt Scotch,89,"Released exclusively for the U.S., this is the first bottling in an annual series celebrating what Macallan terms its “…unrivalled commitment to the mastery of wood and spirit.” Matured in oloroso sherry-seasoned American and European oak casks.

Gingery wood notes in the medium-length finish.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
88,Old Pulteney 25 year old,46,Single Malt Scotch,600,"This 2017 release spent 22 years in bourbon casks before a final 3 years in oloroso sherry Spanish oak butts. Bright fruits on the nose: orange, lemon, and lime, with vanilla, soft toffee, and plain chocolate. Supple and silky on the palate, with sweet orange notes, more vanilla, and cocoa powder. Cocoa, nutmeg, dry sherry, and wood spices in the lengthy finish. (450 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
88,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Cragganmore) 26 year old,50.2,Single Malt Scotch,220,"Lemon and lime zest, stewed fruits drizzled in caramel, granola, butterscotch, and refined oak tones on the nose. The meatiness in Cragganmore’s new make spirit has long since mellowed in the cask. Light orange, vanilla, honey, and those nuggets of hard sherbet that spark up on the tongue. The second phase opens up toffee notes, wood spice, flapjacks, and ends with nougat and orange peel. (Batch 2; 130 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
88,That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 35 year old,46.5,Blended Scotch Whisky,150,"Lighter in character than the 50 year old, batch 4 offers aromas of caramel, artisanal chocolate, red fruits, polished brogues, and a fluttering of Asian spices. It has plenty of personality, with molasses, chocolate treacle cake, date, fig, bramble, and black currant, though those spices return, and then it gets rather woody. A sprightly older blend, but beginning to show its age. (1,428 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
88,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Macduff) 2006 11 year old,53.4,Single Malt Scotch,105,"Distilled in 2006 and aged 11 years in an oloroso hogshead (#101751).

88,Berrys’ Islay Reserve,46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,63,"Gentle peat smoke mixed with smoldering wood shavings, fresh maritime characteristics, and milk chocolate, but leave the glass a while, and when you return, the smoky intensity gets really pumped. Light melon flavors become engulfed by smoke, then the pepper, ginger, and chili kick in, leaving the soft fruit and vanilla cowering lamb-like in a corner. If you have peat smoke running in your veins, you will love this.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
88,Virginia Distillery Company Brewers Batch (Batch 001),46,Craft Whiskey,65,"Delicate, floral, sweet, and reminiscent of a Lowland malt with its Creamsicle nose. Flavors of papaya, bright citrus, and green tea are nicely balanced with the perfect touch of smoke on the pleasingly oily palate, while the long finish smacks of baked apples, cocoa, and minerality. Wonderfully balanced and moreish, this is a happy marriage of Scotch whisky and Virginia single malt whiskey finished in a cask that previously held Wee Heavy style beer.

88,Two Brewers Yukon Single Malt Release 07,43,Canadian,78,"In 2009, brewers Bob Baxter and Alan Hansen added a stillhouse to their Whitehorse-based Yukon Brewing Company. This 7 year old, their seventh whisky, was distilled from Scottish peated malt, creating a smoky, malty, scotch-like nose. Ripe apples, apricots, and other sweet fruits subdue the smoke until the first sip, when it bursts to the fore with a sweet, ashy presence. Smoke and pleasing hot pepper dominate a long finish. (Canada only) $100 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
88,Joseph Magnus Straight Bourbon,50,Craft Whiskey,92,"An aroma you can really chew on, this comes at you big and bold, its dried cherry, fig, and caramel flavors woven with pipe tobacco, licorice, and saddle leather. The jolt of sweetness and spice on the palate pour on and on. Water helps to temper the heat and release even more flavors, with currant, chocolate, and drying oak on the finish. Sourced Indiana bourbon finished in oloroso sherry, Pedro Ximenez, and Cognac casks.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
88,Johnnie Walker Black Label The Director’s Cut,49,Blended Scotch Whisky,80,"A futuristic bottle design released for Ridley Scott’s replicant sequel set in 2049, hence the punchy bottling strength. Peat smoke, toffee caramels, fresh banana, and sliced red apple. Promising layers of fruit salad, grape, apple, citrus, and apricot are swept aside by an aggressive peppery attack, emerging to notes of bitter fruit, burnt rubber, and smoke. If this is a glimpse of the future, I’m stockpiling regular Black Label now. (39,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Bunnahabhain Pedro Ximénez Cask Finish 15 year old,54.3,Single Malt Scotch,99,"This was matured in second-fill sherry casks and then spent 3 years in first-fill Pedro Ximénez butts. The nose features fruit and nutty milk chocolate, fudge, sultanas, and mixed candied peel. Lush, sweet sherry on the palate, with a carryover of fudge and sultanas from the nose. Long in the nutty, spicy finish, which offers nutmeg and peppery oak. (5,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
88,Kilchoman Red Wine Cask Matured,50,Single Malt Scotch,125,"Distilled in 2012, this was aged in casks sourced from the Douro Valley in Portugal. Quite reticent on the early nose, with developing strawberries, vanilla custard, new oak, and subtle smoke. The palate offers smoky red wine notes, with ashy peat, spices, and tingling black pepper becoming more apparent. Sweet cherry fruitiness lingers in the relatively long finish with prickly spices.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
88,St. George 35th Anniversary,41,Craft Whiskey,500,"A perfumed nose of lilac, mint, orange flower water, and powdery Sweethearts candy introduces this pretty whiskey, as distinctive tangerine citrus meets papaya and tropical flavors. The malty palate is broad, sweet, and pure, delivering some bubble gum and confectionery notes. Very enjoyable, and almost juicy in its fruit bomb of flavors.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2018
88,Chicken Cock 8 year old,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"It begins with corn pudding, savory and sweet, developing into cornbread, cookie dough, and tapioca pudding. This is followed by cinnamon bread, raw walnut, and malt. Around mid-palate, a dominating spice kicks in. This spice remains toward the finish, where the cinnamon just pleasantly sits there. Fun sipper.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
88,Exclusive Malts 2005 Ledaig (distilled at Tobermory) 11 year old,57.6,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The nose opens with brine, fresh pine, sage, and sweet antiseptic. Peat, ginger, black pepper, lime, and lemon notes develop in time. Citrus fruits, caramel, and a peat-fueled barbecue on the palate, with background dark berries.

88, Kings County Straight Rye,51,Rye Whiskey,55/375ml.,"An alluring and inviting nose promises sweet tea, mint, dill, and a full Thanksgiving dessert spread. The palate delivers, with flavors of blueberry crumble, cherry tart, and candied ginger. The juicy spice is counterbalanced by oak that’s slightly too bitter and tannic, with notes of dry walnuts and chili powder. But a warm, spicy, and rounded finish helps bring the whiskey home. <em><a href=""/best-empire-rye-new-york/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empire rye</a></em>",Adam Polonski,Spring 2018
88,The English Smokey,43,Single Malt English Whisky,75,"This lives up to its name with leaf bonfire smoke, vanilla essence, and ginger preserves. Distiller David Fitt chooses malt peated to the same level as Port Ellen maltings delivers to Laphroaig. Assertive flavors of raw ginger, peppercorn, and chili flakes succumb to soothing vanilla cream and herbal notes. It leaves a creaminess on the lips and a mouth-coating finish of bonfire smoke and ground pepper. (480 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Moon Harbour Pier #2 Peated Edition,47.1,Blended Scotch Whisky,70,"Was the short finish in Château La Louvière casks from Bordeaux’s Pessac-Léognan appellation sufficient to impact this peaty whisky? A gorgeous color with a nose of sooty, charcoal intensity, hints of chocolate, vanilla pod, clove, and peppercorn. Flavors of cherry, rhubarb, orange peel, and plums, speckled with aniseed, pepper, clove, and licorice indicate cask influence. Suggestions of menthol and peppermint, before a smoky finish with licorice and bitter chocolate. (20,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Chapter 7 2008 (distilled at Allt-a-Bhainne) 9 year old,60.7,Single Malt Scotch,65,"A single cask, cask strength whisky finished in a first-fill bourbon barrel. The initial nose is slightly earthy, with walnuts, Juicy Fruit gum, vanilla, and ripe peach notes in time. Full, sweet fruit notes on the palate, peaches in syrup, overripe pineapple, with milk chocolate, fudge, and nutmeg. The finish is medium in length and perennially spicy, with aniseed notes. (Cask no. 170)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
88,Chapter 7 2008 (distilled at Aultmore) 9 year old,62.2,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Aged in bourbon wood, then finished in an oloroso sherry cask. The result is a whisky with a nutty nose, plus sultanas, figs, vanilla, and background sherry, becoming more floral in time. Full-bodied on the palate, with sweet sherry notes, ginger, and cinnamon, and developing raisin and prune notes. The finish is long, with spicy coffee and blackberries. (Cask no. 900160)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
88,StoneHammer Distiller’s Reserve,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Think cherries—they dominate the nose over earth, oak, and blueberries. Then it’s leather, tobacco, cigar box, and burnt pie crust edges. Finally, two notes become one, as cherry pie, with hints of rhubarb and cola. It sets itself up to be a prime whiskey, but the notes just fall off on a short finish. If only the backbone held up, this could be remarkable stuff.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
88,Lambay Small Batch Blend,40,Blended Irish Whiskey,35,"This Cognac cask-finished whiskey has light, airy aromas of vanilla cream, heather honey, golden syrup, flaked coconut, and whole orange. Baked pastries and tangy orange precede a mid-palate spice rush, with grapefruit flavors building through a lengthy, spicy finish. Several sourced Irish whiskeys use local water to cut down to bottling strength; Lambay uses water drawn from the island’s Trinity Well.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Kurayoshi 18 year old,50,Japanese,220,"The high-alcohol strength is apparent on the nose, which is dominated by pepper, clove, and star anise spices. A mouth-drawing concoction that begins softly, with honey, orange, and apple peel, then grows in scale at the expense of the sweetness. There’s a takeover by root ginger and bitter fruit skins. The long-lasting finish reverberates with crackling spices and sour fruits. (1,140 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Kurayoshi Sherry Cask 3 year old,46,Japanese,80,"Nutty dried fruits, pear and apple, light pepper, and an old knob of dried ginger. The sherry notes are more reminiscent of amontillado or palo cortado. The sherry works well with the whisky, bringing dried peels, nuts, golden caramels, and spicy pepper, the latter surging forth to dominate the last remnants of fudge-like sweetness. Attractively tasty, this has a finish of juicy peel, clove, and pepper. (720 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Reisetbauer 7 year old,43,Austrian Whisky,90,"The youngest offering has an attractive fruity nose with red apple, menthol, and wax candles, all nicely backed with spicy oak. Honey-dipped apple slices, citrus, chocolate-covered raisins, and very gentle spice make this a most agreeable sipping whisky. The finish has coffee grounds with a pinch of spice. Perfectly delicious, it’s just a little meek and light bodied, with a shorter flavor trajectory.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Sierra Norte Single Barrel Black,45,World Whisky,50,"A deeper corn note than White, the Oaxacan black corn retains a firm nugget of sweetness, aromas of banana skins and dusty earth. To sip, it’s creamy, cool, and refreshing, with light mandarin flavors, gingerbread, corn fritters, vanilla, and peppery heat from the French oak cask. The finish has gentle warmth, with root ginger and kernels of roasted corn. Distinctive and highly promising.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
88,Connemara 12 year old,40,Irish,75,"Connemara’s wild west coast landscape is a world away from this peated whiskey’s production at Cooley Distillery on Ireland’s east coast.

88,The Balvenie Peat Week 14 year old (2002 Vintage),48.3,Single Malt Scotch,99,"This expression dates from 2002, when Balvenie first produced a batch of heavily peated malt. Matured in American oak casks, the nose exhibits subtle peat balanced by honey, vanilla, and ripe red apples.

Sweet caramel, smooth honey, zested mandarin, gentle wood spices, Cinnamon Toast Crunch, mango, guava, and papaya, with a finish of cereal notes and dried tropical fruits.

Antiseptic, pine-scented floor cleaner, and an enveloping cloud of peat smoke with underlying peach and faint dabs of lemon. Sugary sweet, with lemon lozenges, light vanilla, caramel, and dark toffee, while a bowling, somersaulting smoky element gleefully turns cartwheels in the mouth.

Brilliant and satisfying.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
89,Cutty Sark Prohibition,50,Blended Scotch Whisky,30,"Bold spicy nose with dark toffee and dried chili flakes. Explosive pepper notes duel with chocolate as they work through the toffee flavors and begin to show a bitter dark chocolate edge.

89,Vinn Rice Whiskey,43,Craft Whiskey,50,"Delicate floral and sweet aromas—peach blossom, honeysuckle, fresh apricot, milk chocolate, and nougat—commingle with earthy, herbaceous notes: espresso bean, log pile, clay. The palate is light-bodied, but doesn’t shortchange on flavor, with vanilla cookie, apricots, hazelnuts in milk chocolate, apple blossom, and salted light caramels. Take your time with this whiskey—it’s mature in flavor, if not in barrel age, and it needs room to unfold its many intriguing layers.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
89,Naked Grouse,43,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,35,"Finishing these malts in first-fill oloroso casks helps produce a tempting nose of tangy marmalade, cherry, chocolate sponge, malt, and apple tart, with a rub of spice. Chocolate, spiced orange, pepper, and ginger notes before sweet toffee breaks through, allowing the orange peel-rich marmalade to mingle with the malt. It’s a big mouthful and definitely one to try.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
89,The Famous Grouse,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,30,"Matthew Gloag introduced this classic blend in 1896, and now Kirsteen Campbell, master blender of Grouse since 2016, is taking it to new heights. Rich toffee, boundless baked orange notes, wood spices, dried banana chips, and some sweet floral top notes. Very smooth drinking, with citrus flavors, toffee and caramel, vanilla, ground ginger, star anise, and lemon peel. The spiciness abounds into the finish with well-rounded dark orange notes.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
89,The Famous Grouse Bourbon Cask,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,35,"Compared to classic Grouse, this has more caramel notes, additional sweetness, and a greater delivery of lemon, vanilla, toasted coconut, and finely shredded orange peel. It’s lightly structured, drier, and comes with less-pronounced spices. Sipping reveals sweet light citrus, smooth caramel, vanilla sponge, apricot, soft fruits, and chocolate macaroon bars, with a late development of spice. Sweet caramel hangs on the lips. This is an easygoing, feel-good whisky.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
89,The Famous Grouse Smoky Black,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,35,"Peated Glenturret lies at the heart of Smoky Black, but where will the master blender find her smoke when the distillery is sold? Contemporary bottlings are rich, warming, and comfortingly smoky, with chocolate, malt, cocoa, burnt fruitcake, and baking spices. Medium-weighted blend with malt, chocolate, and bourbon biscuits, interwoven with smoke, then cherry, baked apple strudel, and chocolate desserts. Dry smoke, ginger, pepper, and dark chocolate to finish.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
89,Chivas Regal Mizunara Cask,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,50,"This whisky is slowly making its way around the world, but it was worth the wait, as master blender Colin Scott’s use of mizunara oak makes for an impressively different nose from Chivas Regal 12 year old. Pecans, sandalwood, coriander seed, honeycomb, peanuts, and rich oak aromas herald a warming dram with fabulously developed orange zest and vanilla toffee flavors, before a more assertive finish of dark toffee and tenacious spices.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
89,Auchentoshan The Bartender’s Malt 001,47,Single Malt Scotch,47,"Twelve of the world’s leading bartenders collaborated to create this limited release. Whiskies chosen spanned five decades, and were aged in various oak barrels, including American and German, as well as rum, red wine, and Laphroaig casks. The nose is rich and fruity, with Jaffa oranges, apricots, caramel, and soft ginger. Voluptuous on the palate, with nectarines, Brazil nuts, nutmeg, and honey. Warming spices in the lengthy finish, with lingering nectarine notes.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
89,Bruichladdich The Classic Laddie (Scottish Barley),50,Single Malt Scotch,55,"Bruichladdich describes this as a “multi-vintage cuvee” and only Scottish-grown barley is used in its distillation. Ozone, lemon juice, fresh-planed wood, and a hint of honey appear on the nose. The palate features toffee apples, cinnamon, ginger, salt, and oily oak. Pepper, sea salt, and relatively dry oak in the finish are balanced by toffee sweetness.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
89,Bunnahabhain 2003 Pedro Ximénez Finish,54.8,Single Malt Scotch,112,"This limited-edition Bunnahabhain was aged in sherry casks until 2011, when it was transferred into first-fill Pedro Ximénez sherry butts. The nose offers leathery sherry, red berries, ozone, and a little black pepper. Rich, sweet fruit notes on the palate; overt sherry, plus toffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of background salt. Cinnamon, honey, and raisins in the long finish. (2,154 bottles for U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
89,Glen Grant 15 year old Batch Strength,50,Single Malt Scotch,77,"Described by its distillers as “the most intensified expression” of Glen Grant, this was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and is non-chill filtered. The nose is fresh and floral, with rose petals, Turkish delight, and cinnamon. Supple on the palate, clean and fruity, with developing soft toffee, pear drops, ginger, and a floral carryover from the nose. The finish is medium in length, with slightly astringent oak.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
89,The Tyrconnell 15 year old Madeira Cask Finish,46,Irish Single Malt,100,"Honey, baklava, lemongrass, artichoke, vanilla, herbal stems, and Turkish delight make for a thought-provoking glass of whiskey. Sipping reveals a gentle, fruity delight; this is silky smooth and packed with dried fruits, mango, papaya, vanilla, light caramel, pleasant spices, and as it unwinds, it oozes honey and sweetness. As the honey and peppery spices fade on the finish, a hint of mint appears.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
89,Kilchoman Port Cask Matured 2018 Edition,50,Single Malt Scotch,125,"The second Kilchoman to be fully matured in port casks, this expression is a vatting of 30 ruby port casks, filled in 2014. The nose offers milk chocolate sprinkled with white pepper, sweet red wine, and ultimately, smoky citrus fruit. Big red berry notes lead on the palate, followed by ginger and spicy peat. Tangy red currants and bonfire smoke in the relatively long finish. Impressive for its age. (10,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
89,Armorik Triagoz,46,French Whisky,75,"Distillerie Warenghem’s first peated malt, using barley malted to 50 ppm. Waves of coastal character, with lemon, vanilla, marzipan, peat smoke, and hints of antiseptic. The taste is akin to devouring the best fudge in the world, with lemon, rich orange peel, pepper, root ginger, and a steadily building cloud of smoke.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
89,Smooth Ambler Big Level Wheated Bourbon,50,Craft Whiskey,55,"The name should give some indication: this is a big, brawny whiskey. Aromas of orange peel, iced tea, toasted coconut, peanut, honey, and molasses spar with grain and dry firewood. The palate delivers oak, more grain, orange oil, menthol, roasted nuts, iced tea, cherries, and cola. Tobacco, leathery oak, and bitter chocolate tie everything together on the finish, which is especially enjoyable with a few drops of water added.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
89,Colkegan Apple Brandy Cask Finished Single Malt,46,Craft Whiskey,65,"Soft and juicy aromas of ginger juice, apple tart, strawberry shortcake, and light, sweet smoke. Very aromatic, with lots of citrus, clove, and cinnamon. Orange Creamsicle on the palate, with a good deal of apple, poached pear, marmalade, and light smoke. Salted butter, gentle oak, and wispy smoke keep this in balance. A good harmony of flavors.",Adam Polonski,Fall 2018
89,Port Charlotte Islay Barley 2011,50,Single Malt Scotch,80,"This includes whisky distilled from barley grown on three Islay farms. It was mainly matured in first-fill American oak, along with Syrah and merlot wine casks. Fragrant peat, warm tar, ginger, vanilla, and sea salt on the nose. Peaches dipped in salt on the palate, with milk chocolate and more vanilla, then dark berries. The peat is spicy and quite acrid in the long, briny finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
89,Wayne Gretzky No. 99 Ice Cask,41.5,Canadian,50,"Wayne Gretzky’s distillery makes serious whisky. A large, copper Vendome column and a Heriot-Watt graduate distiller make for some pretty fine spirit that will eventually fill Gretzky bottles. Sourced for now, this rich, round, and creamy whisky is finished in ice wine casks from Gretzky’s vineyards. Cinnamon-tinged ripe red apples and kiwifruit in sultana syrup, with baking spices and hot white pepper fading into mild barrel notes.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2018
89,J. Henry & Sons 5 year old Wisconsin Straight Bourbon Bellefontaine Reserve,51.72,Craft Whiskey,80,"Vanilla frosting on the nose contrasts with notes of dried flowers, as well as lime, orange, and a floral back note. The palate offers more citrus, along with brown sugar. The finish is smooth and balanced, with dark chocolate and bitter espresso notes hitting home in counterbalance. The flavor opens up with water, revealing a hint of coconut before a long finish of chocolate and baked apple.",David Fleming,Fall 2018
89,Mossburn Signature Casks Series Island Blended Malt,46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,50,"Smoke and spice and all things nice. With Mossburn Cask Bill #1, the blenders created a finishing cask using first-fill bourbon staves with heads of heavily toasted virgin European oak. Baked citrus with some fresh grapefruit sharpness, raw butternut squash, and a cool line in salty smoke. The palate riffs off wine gums, citrus, savory smoke, bitter roots, pepper, and clove, leaving a long, smoky finish.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
89,Smokey Joe Islay Malt,46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,37,"Like sniffing fine soil running through your fingers, with creamy milk chocolate, baked fruit, mild spices, and pungent, acrid smoke that catches the back of the throat. Baked apple, pear, sultana, and cocoa, but then there’s the smoke: an inferno of caustic, thick peat smoke and astringent pepper, the dark recesses of the mouth beginning to blacken. It’s like throwing a punch in slow motion. Try it. (<em>Total Wine exclusive</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
89,Heaven’s Door,45,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"This Tennessee-distilled bouron tastes of crusty cornbread leads off this sweet-styled bourbon brimming with Bit-O-Honey, Peanut Chews, and banana taffy. While the bold sweetness and stone fruits take the lead, there is enough tobacco-laced tannin and spice to back up and balance the initial sweetness, as char-grilled corn flavors take this across the finish line and make it decidedly more-ish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
89,Distillery 291 Single Barrel Colorado Rye Finished with Aspen Staves (Barrel No. 231),50.8,Craft Whiskey,75,"Heady tropical aromas swirl out of the glass: orange peel, guava, hibiscus, sandalwood, cedar, and cinnamon. Fruit—papaya, nectarine, blueberry, citrus, and grape—shows up in force on the palate as well, tempered by oak and milk chocolate, pistachios, and dried flowers. The finish is long and gently spiced, with soft oak, cedar, and cocoa flavors. Distillery 291 bottles all its rye as single-barrel batches of about 55-60 bottles each.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
89,Crown Royal Blenders’ Mash,40,Canadian,28,"Recently, Crown Royal began bottling some of the 50-odd whiskies in its core blend. Hand Selected Barrel and Northern Harvest Rye each peeked behind the blenders’ curtain. Now Blenders’ Mash (originally called Bourbon Mash) unveils the woody vanilla signature of Canada’s bestseller. This approachable, creamy, medium-bodied whisky bathes in sweet vanilla and mild oak tannins, seasoned with peppery spices and fruity-floral esters. Incredibly long, creamy, vanilla finish.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
89,Compass Box Asyla,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,60,"This radiant, refreshing whisky offers creamy fudge, light vanilla, fresh apple, peach, and biscuit notes on the nose, demonstrating the generosity of the American oak. In the mouth, it’s luscious, balanced, and mouth-coating, with sweet honey, lemon peel, lime zest, and aromatic spices, fattening out briefly before becoming soft as suede, riffing on vanilla, melon, and lemon biscuits. Dry finish with vanilla cream and soft fruits.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018

Toffee flavors, with thick smoke, red fruits, orange, raisin, oak spice, gingerbread, marshmallow, strawberry jam, and dark marmalade. Dry finish with bitter peels, dark chocolate, and some feisty spices. In comparison, regular Black Label is silkier, more integrated, and more peppery.

89,Woodford Reserve Double Double Oaked,45.2,Bourbon/Tennessee,50/375ml.,"Toasted oak, coffee, cola, molasses, and campfire smoke linger over a French bakery and baking spices that are both interesting and appealing. Then chocolate, hazelnut, and nutmeg dominate in a dessert-style treat that later introduces custard, banana cream pie, and candy corn. Almond butter appears for the long finish.(Bottled in winter 2017; Kentucky only)",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
89,Woodford Reserve 2017 Master’s Collection Cherry Wood Smoked Barley,45.2,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"A bourbon made with cherrywood-smoked barley in the mash. When chocolate and cherries meet, instant joy can only be improved with roasted nuts sprinkled on top. That’s what happens here. It’s all there in the opening round, followed by toasted oak, tangerine, pumpkin latte, caramel-covered popcorn, and more cherries, from jam to pitted dark cherries and maraschino to cherry fried pie. If you love cherries, this is a must-have.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
89,Aberlour A’Bunadh (Batch 61),60.8,Single Malt Scotch,100,"A’bunadh is matured entirely in Spanish oak oloroso butts, non-chill filtered, and bottled at cask strength. This edition is very rich, with dark berry notes on the nose, hazelnuts, caramel, cinnamon, and orange fondant creams.

89,BenRiach Cask Strength (Batch 2),60.6,Single Malt Scotch,95,"This includes whisky distilled in 2006, 2007, and 2008, and matured in a mixture of bourbon, oloroso, and virgin oak casks.

89,Glenmorangie Spìos,46,Single Malt Scotch,99,"The ninth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition series was matured fully in American oak barrels that previously contained rye whiskey. A reticent early nose: melon and a hint of lemon, then warm, oily cereal notes and honey develop. Initially fruity on the palate, with ripe banana, then slightly earthy, with nutty spice and cocoa powder. Zesty spices in the finish, drinking chocolate, and youthful oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
89,Tullamore D.E.W. XO Caribbean Rum Cask Finish,43,Irish Blended Whiskey,26,"Rum-finishing specialists William Grant &amp; Sons add to Ireland’s league of existing rum-finished whiskeys. The lush tropical fruit complexity is abundant with mango, passion fruit, dried papaya, and green apple on the nose. Red apple flavors dominate with Demerara sugariness, dried strawberry, egg custard, and toffee chews, before drifting off into sweeter, fruitier territory. Short finish with a shot of sweet nutmeg.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
89,Canadian Club 20 year old,40,Canadian,47,"Every now and then, Canadian Club dips into its massive reserves to release a longer-aged version of its core 1858 edition. After an initial hit of toffee, a well-defined woody framework supports signature Canadian Club pruney notes, clean grain, and peppery rye. Brown sugar, unsweetened cereal, and hints of barn boards in the middle follow an inviting crispness, enhanced by mild oak tannins and accented by floral top notes.

89,Singleton of Glendullan 18 year old,40,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Of the three Singleton bottlings, Dufftown is aimed at European markets, Glen Ord at Asia, and Glendullan at the U.S. The oldest expression in the Singleton of Glendullan stable, this boasts a nose of brittle toffee, dried fruits, and new leather. Nutty toffee, drinking chocolate, banana split, and coconut on the smooth, soft palate. Peppery almonds in the slowly drying finish. Good value for the money!",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
89,Hudson Four Grain Bourbon,46,Craft Whiskey,50,"A lovely balance of oak, clove, and sweetness come together on the nose, while the flavor shows both big impact and refinement. Oak-driven in style, with plenty of tannins and tobacco leaf, but the sweetness and structure stand up, pouring flavors of pecan, caramelized nuts, and toasted spices, with hints of pine before the persistent finish. A very solid and nicely polished bourbon.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
89,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Paul John) 6 year old,52.9,Indian Whisky,130,"Where Batch 4 is peaty, Batch 5 is smoky, joining aromas of after-dinner mints, rich orange, fondant creams, salted caramel, and sour fruits. On sipping, mint chocolate finds accord with the nose, before a summit of smoke and pepper, then apple, milk chocolate, creamy coffee, and late black currant notes. The smoke hangs deep at the back of the throat. Good flavor trajectory and complexity, with a drying chocolate finish.(822 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
89,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Glenrothes) 20 year old,52.4,Single Grain Scotch,140,"A delightful whisky with a nose of honey, nectarine, fresh apple, sandalwood, strands of lime, and sweet florals. Sipping unlocks flavors of apple pastries and orange peel, before a powder keg of spices explodes on the tip of the tongue. The aftermath has melting fudge, baked orange, and finishes with hot chili nuts. This hits the trademark flavors of Glenrothes, but the cask strength helps to champion the spices. (Batch 6; 430 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
89,Paul John Kanya,50,Indian Whisky,250,"magine there’s a janitor sweeping up the bisected fruit fallen from that fruit-slicing app: cherries, cooked peach, lingonberry, orange peel, fresh apple, fruit syrup, waxy leaves, and taffy chews. Plump mouthfeel with sweet baked fruits, it’s sticky and concentrated with a fabulous fruitiness at this strength. Sugared apple, baked orange, tart plum, clove, and aniseed. Unpeated and matured for around 7 years. A lot of buck for the bang. (1,500 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
89,Exclusive Malts (Distilled at Benrinnes) 2006 11 year old, 49.1,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Distilled in 2006 and aged for 11 years in a PX sherry hogshead (#310110). Peach blossom, vanilla, and icing sugar on the nose, which becomes more floral in time. Smooth and very sweet on the substantial palate: canned pineapple in syrup, malt, and a sprinkling of cinnamon. Vibrant pineapple and sweet oak notes last to the very end of the lengthy finish. (234 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
89,Exclusive Malts (distilled at Royal Brackla) 2006 11 year old,58.2,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Distilled in 2006, this was filled into a virgin French oak cask (#310865) and bottled at cask strength after 11 years.

89,Blood Oath Pact 4,49.3,Bourbon/Tennessee,100,"It starts out with several forms of wood—split, toasted, charred, and smoldering—and develops baking spices, baked apple, caramel, popcorn, and earth. A tingle hits throughout the palate, as rounded notes of chocolate, cabernet, roasted marshmallow, and white pepper develop over lingering vanilla. Candied corn and cinnamon butter develop into a medium to long finish. (36,000 bottles)",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
89,J.P. Wiser’s Triple Barrel Rye,43.4,Canadian,23,"This reformulated blend pushes classic Canadian whisky toward bigger, rye-forward flavors. Slowly, honey donuts and ripe fruit add breadth to a robust, almost oily nose. The caramel-sweet and slightly slippery palate seethes with peppery rye spices. Rugged yet balanced, with subtle complexities, the whisky develops an earthiness and almost grassy cereal notes. Gently warm going down, with cleansing bitter citrus pith on a sweet, longish finish. (Canada only) $30 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2018
89,Redemption Wheated Bourbon,48,Bourbon/Tennessee,46,"Chocolate, vanilla cream fried pie, and herbs offer insight into this opening round of a fabulous whiskey. Cornbread, pecan pie, roasted walnuts, and chocolate-flavored coffee hit mid-palate, followed by cinnamon roll, pumpkin spice, and mint. But the finish falls slightly short, only offering a hint of caramel.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
89,The Whistler 7 year old Natural Cask Strength,59,Irish Single Malt,77,"This dials up the aromas so high it could freshen up a stadium. After a riot of bright fruits, paradise slice, nutmeg, cinnamon, dates, and raisin, the palate becomes awash with apple and rose hip, though the strength makes it a wild ride, the tongue is conquered into submission. Diluted, it shines with vanilla sponge cake, plum, malt, and spicy nutmeg. Beautiful whiskey, just needs to be pegged back a bit. €65",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
89,The Dead Rabbit,44,Irish Blended Whiskey,43,"Co-founders of New York’s The Dead Rabbit Bar Sean Muldoon and Jack McGarry add their own 5 year old single malt and grain whiskeys to their supplies of grog. Sweetness, caramel, vanilla, and scents of dried fruits. The flavors captured in a light frame reveal citrus peel, malt, dark cookies, a rumble of spice, and conclude with dried peels dipped in chocolate. Drying, with spice and orange. Decent whiskey for sure, but a rather conservative first release for The Dead Rabbit.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
89,Dewar’s 12 year old The Ancestor,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,33,"A straightforward proposition of honey, vanilla sponge cake, barley notes, hints of apple, fresh banana, melon, and bundles of dry straw. It’s a sweetheart: soft vanilla fudge, heather honey, banana-topped banoffee pie, fudge, vanilla sandwich cookies, barley sugar, and lemon peel, with hardly any spice in the early phase. The finish has a snag of pepper at the end, but this is gorgeously tasty, with smooth vanilla fudge all the way.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,BenRiach 21 year old,46,Single Malt Scotch,174,"BenRiach’s latest release was matured in a combination of four diverse cask types: bourbon, virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez sherry, and red wine.

89,GlenDronach Peated Port Wood,46,Single Malt Scotch,97,"This is non-chill filtered and carries no age statement. The nose is earthy, with damp herbaceous borders, quite acrid smoke, and spicy cranberries. Fresh, juicy red berries on the palate, with background peat smoke becoming ashy, with rich red wine notes. The red wine persists in the finish, accompanied by prickly black pepper. <em>£70; Not available in the U.S.</em>",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
89,Mackmyra Moment Körsbär,47,Single Malt Swedish Whisky,145,"This rufescent whisky evokes aromas of cherry blossom, kirsch, white pepper, and wood spices. Light cherry syrup, caramel, and toffee, with a strident eruption of black pepper and clove that sets the underside of your tongue alight. Körsbär is Swedish for cherry and the fat red berry flavors leave a lovely warm glow inside. Despite its color, the sweet cherry wine finish has been judged to perfection. (SEK1198; Not available in the U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,Finger Lakes Distilling McKenzie Straight Rye,45.5,Rye Whiskey,42,"A beguiling nose, replete with cinnamon crumble, blueberry bubble gum, and cardamom. This whiskey bakes you a blackberry pie with a flaky crust and vanilla whipped cream, rounded out with cinnamon, dill, and oregano. The finish has clove-spiced orange peel, lingering sweet marshmallow, and a surprising minerality. This is at least a year older than some of the other Empire ryes, and it shows. Craft skeptics, seek this out. <em><a href=""/best-empire-rye-new-york/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Empire rye</a></em>",Adam Polonski,Spring 2018
89, Exclusive Malts 2002 (distilled at Miltonduff) 14 year old,54.1,Single Malt Scotch,140,"The initial nose is herbaceous, with green apples, then brittle toffee. Developing Juicy Fruit gum flavors.

89,West Cork Glengarriff Series Bog Oak Charred Cask,43,Irish Single Malt,45,"Irish bog oak can lie preserved under the turf for thousands of years. The whiskey’s nose is cool and clean, the smoke refined and rather elegant, with aromas of Brazil nut shells, fine Madagascan chocolate, and dark, unlacquered walking canes. Rich and sweet with chocolate orange, fiery spice, ginger cake, menthol, and root ginger, crumbling into bitter orange peel, bark, molasses, and coffee grounds. Finish of bitter roots and ginger. (4,800 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,The English Original,43,Single Malt English Whisky,75,"Malt barns, cornflakes, some sparse vanilla, redskin peanuts, citrus peel, and a dash of white pepper on the nose. The overall impression on the olfactory system is gentle and mild. A tasty prospect, with poached pear, vanilla ice cream, honeydew, peppery spices, ground almond, custard tarts, lemon zest, malt, and peanut brittle. A little tangy citrus, deep warmth, and vanilla to finish. Rather moreish. (480 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,Barrell New Year 2018 Limited Edition,55.6,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"Quince, coconut, raspberry, and chocolate walk into an array of breads—sourdough, cornbread, Lebanese pita, and pumpernickel rye. Soon a sweetness develops over earthiness. Think hazelnut latte paired with rich lentil soup, followed by jalapeño cornbread and honey. Its strength never shows, but that promise in the taste is not followed in the finish, which is shorter than expected. If the finish held up, it would be a much stronger whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
89,Bruichladdich Octomore 08.1,59.3,Single Malt Scotch,165,"Distilled in 2008 from 100 percent Scottish barley peated to 167 ppm. It spent 8 years in first-fill American oak casks. Peaches dipped in hot plain chocolate and tarry peat on the fragrant nose. The palate offers sweet, creamy orchard fruits and honey, backed by citrus-laden peat. Drying in the finish to quite a bitter, tannic smokiness. (42,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
89,Ohishi Kaito’s Cask,41.8,Japanese,90,"Spicy rice crackers, plum sauce, bramble jelly, fragrant oriental spices, and the polished leather of new shoes from this single cask, sherry-matured rice whisky. The syrupy texture bursts with juicy red fruits, plum, red currant, pomegranate, and cooked peach, all bolstered by peppercorns and ground ginger. An enchanting harmony is struck between the fruits and the spice, though the finish is short, with sherry notes and spicy remnants. (660 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,Single Cask Nation (distilled at Tormore) 21 year old,49,Single Malt Scotch,165,"This was distilled in February 1996, matured in a second-fill bourbon barrel, and bottled in April 2017. The nose yields nectarines, vanilla ice cream, fudge, and milk chocolate. Smooth and rounded on the palate, with ripe apples, toffee, walnuts, and ultimately, a hint of lemon, plus black pepper. Nutty and subtly spicy in the lengthy finish. (156 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
89,The Sexton,40,Irish Single Malt,28,"One of the most striking-looking new releases around, this bone-jangling, sepulchral, triple-distilled whiskey was once entombed in oloroso sherry butts. A nose of baked apple and sultana, rolled marzipan, sesame seeds, and roasted spices. Smooth tasting, with dark fleshy fruits, mixed peel, chocolate, walnut; the taut spicy middle section dies back to baked oranges. A dignified finish, with chocolate and nutmeg at the death. Ingest in peace.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89,Kurayoshi 12 year old,46,Japanese,100,"This is airily fruity, with a greater emphasis on red fruits: strawberry jam, red apple, and red currant. With greater age, the five-spice and ground ginger are dialed up a couple of notches. A thick, jammy texture with flavors of red apple, malt, peppercorn, and chili flakes, glimpses of chocolate and cocoa, though the spices slacken with dilution. Finish of ground coffee, cooking chocolate, and fading spice. (2,160 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
89, Eagle Rare 17 year old (2017 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection),45,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"At first it’s a confectionery delight, with notes of cotton candy, caramel, burnt brown sugar, and praline. Then a spice explosion hits as the caramel becomes more defined. We’re talking pumpkin pie spice with hints of allspice, cardamom, and clove. Tobacco and stone fruit develop toward the end. Alas, its medium finish, with a hint of oak, doesn’t continue the complexity found on the palate.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
89,Old Forester Birthday Bourbon 2017,48,Bourbon/Tennessee,80,"A beautiful opening of oak, butterscotch, and fruit quickly becomes more pronounced in banana and pineapple. Then baked apple, Bananas Foster, caramel pudding, and salt water taffy. Hints of smoke and paprika lurk, but marzipan and orange blossom honey nail the landing. The finish doesn’t hold up to the palate, only offering a hint of caramel. Very good, but not quite outstanding.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
89,Glen Elgin 18 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),54.8,Single Malt Scotch,340,"Matured in European oak butts, this 1998 single malt has a nose of soft toffee, vanilla, and orchard fruits.

89, Port Askaig 110° Proof,55,Single Malt Scotch,75,"A U.S.-exclusive variant of this popular Islay single malt. Lemon juice and warm granite on the nose, backed by sweet heather, ginger, and developing Jaffa orange, medicinal peat, and charcuterie.

89, Teaninich 17 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),55.9,Single Malt Scotch,310,"Distilled in 1999, this single malt was aged in refill American oak hogsheads and refill American oak barrels. Pineapple and walnuts figure on the early nose, which becomes more floral, ultimately offering violets. The palate is full and fruity, majoring in peaches in syrup, with new-mown hay and white pepper. Nicely balanced and rounded, with buttery notes emerging. The finish dries slowly, with subtle licorice.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
89,Teeling Revival Volume IV 15 year old,46,Irish,141,"Part of a series of innovative wine finishes marking the revival of distilling in Dublin. The fourth release spent a year finishing in sweet, aromatic Muscat casks, imparting the bouquet of a rose garden, with ripe peach, satsuma peel, peppercorn, and black cardamom.

89,Scallywag 13 year old,46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,83,"Scallywag is no lapdog; this mutt runs off the leash and disappears down a rabbit hole. The first thing that strikes is a spicy blast of cardamom, fennel, and onion seeds. Baked chestnut, grapefruit, baked orange, plum, and walnut aromas. Warm marmalade with thick peel, a fanfare of spices, and brown sugar cubes. Gratifying finish of grapefruit peel and a burning core of spice deep in the throat.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017

89,Inchmoan Vintage 1992,48.6,Single Malt Scotch,350,"A peated malt from Loch Lomond, this vintage expression spent 25 years in refill bourbon barrels. A delicate, mildly smoky nose, with vanilla, gentle spice, black pepper, and a subtle medicinal characteristic. Soft and fruity on the palate, with encroaching earthiness and dry peat smoke. The smoke lingers in the lengthy finish, with vanilla, aniseed, and spicy, slightly tannic oak.",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
89,J. Mossman Pink Gold Crown 18 year old,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,68,"On safe territory here, with neroli oil, caramel, roasted spices, surly peat smoke, and just enough fruity sweetness to stay in the good books. Weightier than the 15 year old, with more aged whisky characteristics: bright clementine, dried citrus wheels, and clove, but after an eruption of smoke, it fades to pineapple, fermenting fruits, and a prickly grapefruit acidity. The ashy embers on the finish retreat quickly.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
89,Fukano 12 year old Single Cask No. 275,41.9,Japanese,100,"Brown rice, balsamic vinegar, hoisin sauce, spiced rhubarb, white pepper, and clove make this an intriguing and appetizing olfactory experience. The palate is fruitier, with dark citrus, stewed apple, star fruit, taffy candy, and orange Jell-O, drifting to light pepperiness and aniseed. A drying aftertaste homes in on orange peel, with some late spice contributions. Complex flavor combinations make this a great exploratory whisky for seasoned enthusiasts.

90,Knappogue Castle 12 year old Château Pichon Baron French Oak Cask-Finished,46,Irish Single Malt,80,"Clean and fresh aromas of raspberry jam and vanilla cream spread thickly on warm scones, speckled with fragrant spices of pepper and grated nutmeg. An instant spicy kick is followed by a flood of warm fruitiness in the mouth, then baked goods and dried citrus.

(1,020 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
90,Compass Box No Name (No. 2),48.9,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,150,"So good, they didn’t name it twice. More brooding than the first iteration, with a heavy curtain of ashy sooty smoke, fresh herbal tones, lemon, and dried fruity sweetness. The palate is led by red cherry, plum, cranberry, and tangy orange peel, then hot smoke sets off a peppery firecracker. The structure is deceptively light, developing more grip as the lemon sherbet sweetness heralds the lengthy finish of beach bonfire smoke. (8,436 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019

Quaker Oats, golden syrup, and chocolate-covered graham crackers with cherries set the scene, though spices quickly engulf them. Perfect harmony is reestablished as it fattens out with cinnamon toffee. Bold, robust, and triumphant: just add a Dublin pub weekend crowd and you’re all set.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
90,Kavalan 10th Anniversary Bordeaux Pauillac Wine Cask-Matured Single Malt,57.8,Taiwanese Whisky,283,"Enticing aromas of clove, cranberry, cooking apple, hawthorn, allspice, tobacco, and graphite sticks.

A dry nose with rye spices and overripe pears is quite complex. The palate, sweet and somewhat drying, suddenly shows strong ripe cherry notes, then pipe tobacco, cigar box, lingering heat, medium weight, gorgeous woody notes, and strong peppery spices. Hints of rye spices punctuate a long, hot, and fruity finish. 150 CAD",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2019
90,Teerenpeli Portti Single Malt,43,World Whisky,125,"This impressive whisky lets the port lead the dance, but never treads on the toes of its partner. The nose reveals prominent cask influences of pomegranate, inky plum flesh, blackberry, and gummy cherries, with a supporting cast of honeycomb, dried herbs, and bay leaf.

This is sweet, silky, and carefree, with citrus, honey, oat cereal, and black pepper. The spices grip the tongue, yielding to flavors of crystallized pineapple and grapefruit in the latter stages.

90,The Matsui Mizunara Cask,48,Japanese,90,"Very pale, fresh whisky, with lychee, fresh pear, morning dew, apple notes, and just a dash of salt and white pepper. It’s a honeyed and thick dram on the palate, with caramelized apples and tangerine, then late bittersweet citrus that attempts to dampen down the jackhammer of pepper. Enjoyable weight, texture, and flavors, but the mizunara signature notes are a little subtle and underplayed. (3,972 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
90,Jameson Caskmates Great Divide Brewing Co. Edition,40,Irish Blended Whiskey,30,"The association with this Denver brewery has produced a whisky redolent of crabapple, tinned peach, leather bootstraps, vanilla pod, roasted malt, and spices left to blacken in the pan. This is a scrumptious whisky layered with mixed citrus, honey, shortbread, and lashings of vanilla creaminess. The clove, ground ginger, and black pepper lay down a solid foundation, superimposed with oak char and black coffee grounds in the latter stages.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019

Lemon meringue pie, tangerine zest, lime, and pineapple form the whisky’s substance, which is augmented by a time-delayed progression through caramel, ground almond, espresso, and chocolate brownie. Smoke hangs like a specter at the feast.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019

90,Teerenpeli Kaski,43,Single Malt Finnish Whisky,125,"The nose is lavish, with dried orange peel, raisins, plum, gingersnaps, aniseed, and menthol. It’s a thick, malty, statement whisky, rich with raisin, prune juice, heather honey, fig, and walnut, and laced with aniseed and clove.

90,Dublin Liberties Keeper’s Coin 16 year old,46,Irish Single Malt,379,"Mandarin segments, ripening lime, brown sugar breakfast pastries, cardamom, star anise, marzipan, and seasoned oak on this triple-distilled Irish single malt. It’s fruity, sweet, full-bodied, and wonderfully rich thanks to the Pedro Ximénez finish. It glides from tangy orange to marmalade, with fruit-flavored hard candy, clove, and allspice.

90,Tommyrotter Cider Cask Finished Tennessee Straight Whiskey,47.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"Hugely herbal from the start: coriander seed, licorice, dill, and black tea aromas, with some grape and blueberry jam, lemon, and oak.

90,Driftless Glen Bourbon,48,Bourbon/Tennessee,46,"Orange, lemon peel, iced tea, cinnamon, and blueberry jam aromas are undercut by earthy notes of mulch, chili powder, cracked corn, and dill. Oak leads the flavor parade, but is well-tempered by raspberry, pomegranate, cinnamon, orange, licorice, walnuts, and black pepper. Chocolate, more pomegranate, chili powder, and silky oak round out this lush bourbon, which shows impressive maturity for its 2 years.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
90,Murray McDavid 2003 Òrdha Meas 13 year old,46,Blended Scotch Whisky,55,"An incredible surround-sound sensation of heavy peat smoke, with toffee, blackened spices, salted caramel, and warm leather. The journey is impressive, from the sweet toffee torn asunder by huge gusts of pepper, the tangy strands of citrus and banoffee pie with baked banana, the apples baked in brown sugar, before a final return to the smoke. A sweet and spicy finish, though the flavors recede fairly rapidly.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019

Without water, the proof shows itself, but add a few drops and what was a dry brush fire is now smoked chili-chocolate, cinnamon, black pepper, orange oil, almonds, and a little bacon. Ashy and sweet on the finish, with chili heat, orange, nuts, and chocolate. Potentially divisive in its profile, but its powerful character is undeniable.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019

Unique and confident whisky with an inky blue-fruit finish matched with dry and gentle spiciness. (3,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
90,Kaiyo Mizunara Oak Cask Strength,53,Japanese,89,"Fully matured in mizunara oak on land and sea, this has tangy orange, ground ginger, fennel seed, cedar, and incense, though it seems a little more tightly wound than the standard strength whisky. Juicy orange, quick firecracker spices, and more toffee sweetness; it becomes heavy and thick, flaunting high alcohol, then turns creamier with marzipan, orange Jell-O, and singed oak spices.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2019
90,Kaiyo Mizunara Oak The Peated (2nd Edition),46,Japanese,89,"This is utterly unique; made from imported Scottish peated malt, it spends 2 years in madeira casks, then 6 years in mizunara casks.

90,Compass Box Juveniles,46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,150,"A blend of four single malts for the latest incarnation, this has poached pear, sweet green apple, melon skins, light spices, barley sugar, and yet some crunchy barley notes too.

The flavor is more refined with greater complexity; not overly sweet or fruity, but a smooth-as-satin mouthfeel with shades of pear, caramel covered in white chocolate, nuts, pleasant pot still spiciness, rich toffee, cocoa, and red chili. The cognac cask influence is gentle and works well, and it concludes with a hazelnut butter finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
90,Dillon’s Three Oaks,43,Canadian,50,"Hail the new distillers who have so broadened the profile of rye whisky. All rye grain, some matured in new American and Canadian oak and some in bourbon barrels, yields a complex palate woven into sweet citrus reminiscent of Grand Marnier. Fresh linen with the waxiness of a wet oil painting, tart gooseberries, creamy vanilla caramels, nutty cereals, and peppery spices. Finishes sweet with ripe fruit, white pepper, and halva.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2019
90,Royal Salute 21 year old Beach Polo Edition,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,140,"A beautifully balanced blend of fudge, vanilla, strawberry bubble gum, warm orange, and cinnamon, with ozone and peat smoke. Soft, slightly bitter fruits melt into a creamy silky concoction of Horlicks, white chocolate, and vanilla, with chewy toffee sweetness. The smoking embers of peat catch on the finish with a little menthol and peppermint. Robust enough for beach parties and weddings, not just polo matches. (<em>Global Travel Retail</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
90,Clyde May’s Cask Strength Alabama Style 10 year old Whiskey,57,American Whiskey (Unspecified),100,"The nose offers aromas of fragrant oak, baked apple, caramel, clove, cinnamon, bananas, and creamy vanilla, set against an herbal back note of tarragon. The palate offers cigar box, slate, chocolate, caramel, and chili pepper. Water coaxes fruit notes of blackberry, lemon, and cherry, as well as chocolate-nut cake. A long finish has notes of tobacco, warm chocolate syrup, and toasted almonds. Rich, layered, complex, and eminently pleasurable.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
90,The Irishman Founder’s Reserve,40,Irish Blended Whiskey,30,"Butter, salted caramel, vanilla fudge, firm but tolerant spices—notably white pepper—red apple, and strands of orange zest. After a juicy orange opener, a delicious wave breaks over the tongue, bringing toffee, caramel, cappuccino, hints of chocolate, and a good balance of spices. The finish is spiced fruit with notes of burnt butter, clove, and coffee. This signature blend is consistently one of their best whiskeys.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
90,The Irishman Single Malt Small Batch 2018,40,Irish Single Malt,50,"This noses of crumbly shortbread, vanilla, caramel, orange peels, summer blooms, walnut, and earthy whole spices, but it’s more reserved than their 12 year old. It glides through orange, spun sugar, almond paste, a slow burn of spices, butterscotch, and vanilla, before more sherry fruit comes through. Peppercorn and dark berry mark the finish of this graceful, mellow, and subdued limited-release, triple-distilled whiskey.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
90,Old Pepper Straight Rye (Barrel G18Q),55.35,Rye Whiskey,80,"A characterful, if peculiar whiskey that suggests younger rye. Horehound, citronella oil, scented geranium, and lemon balm contribute to an intensely herbal, slightly antiseptic aroma. There is a compelling bitter edge to the flavor, like biting into orange peel, while the finish is intensely woody and mouth-coating. Not for everyone, but quite captivating and flavorful.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Spring 2019
90,Westland Reverie Fig. 1,50,Single Malt American Whiskey,110,"Each release of the limited-edition Reverie series will be different from the last, as Westland explores the boundaries of single malt blending. Spice and fragrant oak on the nose, delicately floral, with light fruitiness on the palate and a hint of peat. A spicy, white pepper note precedes a lengthy finish of apricot, honeycomb, and then more spiciness. This whiskey floats like a butterfly, but has plenty of heft, depth, and balance. (900 bottles; distillery only)",David Fleming,Spring 2019
90,Navazos Palazzi Overseas Malt Single Sherry Cask,52.5,Spanish Whisky,104,"Although distilled in Scotland, this completed its maturation in Spain; it’s not scotch, but it is very tasty. Cocoa powder, melted milk chocolate, ground hazelnut, vanilla pod, snuff, and allspice go full tilt at cask strength. Chocolate fondant pudding, baked fruit, cocoa, malt, dried fig, black pepper, and black fruits operate with a dark, tangy edge that ignites the tongue. This has been bottled at a perfect strength. (900 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
90,Duncan Taylor Octave The Huntly 1998 19 year old,53.3,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,150,"This is really intriguing, with the vitality of fresh green shoots in spring, fresh-mown lawns, snow peas, pencil shavings, dragon fruit, beet chips, and the exotic scents of a spice market. The taste is gentle with lime, herbal notes, cream soda, generous buttery caramel, and some boisterous spices that loiter into the finish.

90,Duncan Taylor Rare Auld Grain (distilled at Strathclyde) 1990 28 year old,51.2,Single Grain Scotch,170,"Baked lemons, light caramel, throat lozenges, and a butteriness to the nose, the grain character complemented by sweetness and warmer fruits. Light red fruits, butterscotch, Scottish tablet, with a nippy herbal bite to the palate and a deep, persistent burn of cracked black pepper spiciness that glows long into the finish. Strathclyde showing lots of enjoyable distillery character here.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
90,Barrell Bourbon (Batch 017),56.25,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"A selection of bourbons distilled and aged in Tennessee, Indiana, and Kentucky.

The palate is creamy and sweet, offering caramel, chocolate frosting, coconut shavings, a fruity note of sweet raspberry, and chili pepper. A finish of tobacco leaf, dark chocolate, and more spiciness as a final note.",David Fleming,Spring 2019
90,Barrell Dovetail Cask Strength (Batch 001),61.45,American Blended Whiskey,90,"There’s personality galore in this blend of 10 year old Indiana whiskey finished in cabernet sauvignon casks and 11 year old Tennessee bourbon finished in rum casks and port pipes.

90,J.P. Wiser’s Triple Barrel Rye,45,Canadian,20,"Begins light on the nose with clean grain, then spring flowers and persistent, strong blackberry notes move in. Wonderfully balanced, even as blackberries remain strong across the palate, accented by tart kiwi fruit and rich spices: ginger, cloves, nutmeg. Fruits and spices complement each other as the round, creamy palate fades into a long, hot, peppery finish. Beautiful whisky exclusive to the U.S., and fruitier than the 43.4% Canadian version. <em>Best Value</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2019
90,Octomore Edition 09.3 Dialogos,62.9,Single Malt Scotch,230,"Distilled from 52 tons of Islay barley and filled into 134 casks, most of which were second fill. At 5 years old, the result is whisky with an initially fresh and zesty nose, featuring sea breezes and lemon juice. Mild iodine, ginger, and sweet peat then develop.

90,Dogfish Head Alternate Takes Vol. 1: Whiskey Finished in Rum Casks,45,American Whiskey (Unspecified),45,"An intriguing first release from one of craft beer’s most inventive producers. Like many whiskeys made by brewers, this one’s charm is in its deceptive simplicity that reveals successively complex character with every sip. The rum-cask finish is evident throughout: caramel-banana sundae, marzipan, and pistachio pudding on the nose, along with rose petals, meringue, and a touch of suntan lotion. The palate has fresh banana, rose water, pistachio kheer, almonds, lemon, and lime sherbet. Oak asserts itself on the perfumy, elegant finish.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Spring 2019
90,Johnnie Walker Green Label 15 year old,43,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,65,"A staple in the liquor cabinet, this hearty, malty dram conveys peppery smoke, kippers, dry spices, pencil shavings, a biscuit-like cereal note, and more pungent peat smoke as the glass warms up. Among others, this comprises Talisker, Linkwood, Cragganmore, and Caol Ila malts.

90,Parker’s Heritage Collection 2018 Orange Curaçao Finished,55,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"This is sure to be a divisive edition, but once you open your mind to the idea, it’s hard to argue with the titillating aromas and seductive sweetness that curaçao casks bring. Resembling a bourbon liqueur, the nose is replete with tangerine, orange peel, tropical fruit, and nougat. The palate circles back to classic bourbon notes that manage to find balance with the candied orange nose.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
90,Balvenie DoubleWood 25 year old,43,Single Malt Scotch,600,"This limited edition bottling celebrates the 25th anniversary of the DoubleWood releases.

90,Heaven Hill 27 year old Barrel Proof,47.35,Bourbon/Tennessee,400,"A bold nose smacks of sweetness and deep layers of leathery oak and toasted nuts. The palate pours sweet initially, with earthy dried apples, citrus, and bread crust, before the bitter citrus pith and tobacco notes rush in, turning dry and tannic, with tea leaves, dried herbs, and cigar wrapper. Finals wisps of varnish are a hallmark of age. This elder statesman deserves respect, but is nonetheless past its prime.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
90,Brenne 10 year old (2017 Release),48,French Whisky,100,"Rich, supple cognac aromas fit for twilight sipping on a blustery afternoon: cooked apple, prune juice, cinnamon, pecan pie, walnut, and white pepper. A luscious palate of marron glacé, nutmeg, dusty cocoa, prune, toffee apple, nutty dark chocolate brownies, black truffle, and clove. A more rounded, darker, and better-balanced whisky than the restrained 2016 release with its taut, citrus grip. Brenne has found its sweet spot.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
90,Shieldaig 18 year old Highland,40,Single Malt Scotch,47,"An array of flowers and fruits tumbles from the glass: lilacs, orange blossom, lemon oil, raspberry, blueberry, shelled walnuts, and a hint of licorice. Very light-bodied, but with entrancing candied citrus peel, bubble gum, and strawberry candy flavors, along with sherry cask notes of walnut, hazelnut, milk chocolate, raisin, and ginger.

90,Shieldaig 14 year old Islay,40,Single Malt Scotch,60,"The nose offers rubbery-sweet peat and an array of fruit: apples, strawberries, raspberries, guava, mango, watermelon, and jackfruit, shot through with briny oyster shells. Juicy fruit—kiwi, guava, orange, pineapple—on the palate mingles with minerality, medicinal peat, dark chocolate, and salt. The finish is beach bonfire smoke, grilled pineapple, and finally, tobacco leaf. This is balanced and beautiful, but would be downright stunning at a higher proof.

90,Old Fitzgerald 9 year old Bottled in Bond,50,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"A somewhat tight nose, with cocoa, spiced oak, brown sugar, and saddle leather; water reveals vivid vanilla and a bit of banana. The initial honeyed sweetness and chocolate-covered peanut cluster flavors quickly get brushed aside by the tannic oak and searing spice. Drinks a bit hot and hurried—with Szechuan pepper heat before a jolt of citrus oil. (18,000 bottles)",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
90,Westland Garryana (Batch 3|1),56,Craft Whiskey,150,"The third release of Westland’s single malt aged in native Garryana oak from the Northwest.

90,West Cork Glengarriff Series Peat Charred Cask,43,Irish Single Malt,45,"In one of the year’s most intriguing experimental techniques, Glengarriff treats new barrels with burning peat to imbue a fine veneer of smoke over the surface of the vessel’s virgin oak staves. A final finishing in these smoked barrels imparts the captivating pleasure of chocolate brownie, campfire smoke, and sweet cocoa aromas that yield to a pleasantly oily, rounded whiskey with citrus, Jolly Rancher hard candy, chocolate cake, spices, and coffee notes, with a finish of festive spices.

90,Sierra Norte Single Barrel Yellow,45,World Whisky,50,"Master mezcalero Douglas French captures the flavor of native Oaxacan heirloom corn in this unique and singular spirit—the first single-barrel Mexican whisky available in the U.S. Distilled in San Agustín de las Juntas, each of French’s trio of whiskies uses a single variety of ancestral corn that requires hand-harvesting, promoting jobs in traditional farming. Aged for a mere 10 months in French oak, Yellow has swirling notes of blue iris, dried chilies, and fresh linen around a core of plump corn, with tangy marmalade, maple syrup, pepper, and a spiced-honey finish. <em><a href=""/top20/2018/20-sierra-norte-single-barrel-yellow/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 20 in the 2018 Top 20 </a></em>",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018

90,Kikori Ten,41.2,Japanese,180,"A decade of aging in an oloroso cask has bestowed aromas of stewed plum, prune, throat lozenges, and thick fronds inside a tropical palm house, while still executing the same dreamily serene Kikori character. Age has enhanced the mouthfeel of this rice whisky, serving up a smooth, clean palate of tart orange, damson, and plum sweetness, with a complex twist of spice and drying orange peel on the finish. (312 bottles for U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
90,Doc.52 Blended Straight Whiskey,56,American Blended Whiskey,50,"Not a hair out of place here. On the nose, there are cooked bananas and poached pears with a wave of spices—allspice, cinnamon, cloves, pepper, and mace—as well as iced tea, orange peel, and the distinct aromas of a tobacco barn. The chewy, oak-driven palate showcases blackberry jam, cooked cherries, peanut chews, Coca-Cola, ginger, allspice, dark chocolate, and sassafras.

Those same fruits tumble over each other on the palate, which is light but complex, with gentle spice, cigar wrapper, dark chocolate, and slightly drying oak. The finish, though light, retains length through chocolate, tobacco, and polished oak flavors. This tastes remarkably good at its low proof, but what a thing it would be at 46%.

90,Jameson Bow Street 18 year old Cask Strength,55.3,Blended Irish Whiskey,200,"This whiskey finishes its maturation at Bow St., Dublin, the first time this former distillery site has been involved in any whiskey production since 1975. A beautiful balance between toffee, spice, and oak, this has aromas of concentrated citrus, polished oak tables, caramels, and nut brittle.

90,Compass Box Delilah’s XXV,46,Blended Scotch Whisky,100,"Dried heather, peppercorn, salt crystals, green fruits, dried fennel, aniseed, dry leaves, and floral top notes produce a lip-smacking bouquet like a chilled manzanilla.

90,Bernheim Original 7 year old Straight Wheat,45,Wheat Whiskey,30,"Wheated bourbon fans will enjoy this wheat whiskey with its distinctly bourbon nose of sweet cornbread and new oak, topped off with mint and pine aromas. It starts soft on the palate, but flavors build nicely as it rolls along, delivering graham cracker, citrus fruit, pecans, and cake batter. It remains really fresh and lovely, as caramel corn and drying cocoa powder emerge on the finish. A well-crafted and easy-drinking alternative to bourbon.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
90,BenRiach Temporis 21 year old,46,Single Malt Scotch,265,"Temporis is a peated variant of BenRiach, and like its unpeated 21 year old stablemate it was matured in a mix of four types of barrels: bourbon, virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez, and oloroso sherry.

90,Amrut Peated,46,Indian Whisky,80,"Smoked meat, paprika, cumin, peppercorn, and star anise, amid fragrant smoke and maple bacon. The flavors are supremely fruity with tangerine, marmalade, lime zest, and pineapple juice. Among the fruit is a cascade of aromatic spices, before the interjection of a most compelling sour fruit note, and the smokiness takes charge. It’s certainly no Islay mimic, this terrific Indian whisky demonstrates it has the courage of its own convictions.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
90,Port Askaig 14 year old Bourbon Cask,45.8,Single Malt Scotch,100,"This limited edition was distilled in 2004 and aged in eleven first-fill bourbon barrels.

Rich and beefy on the nose: charred brisket, salted meat, tangerines, dark wood, brine, and white smoke. The palate is powerful, oak-forward without being astringent, and very spicy. Walnut, cayenne pepper, and grilled citrus balance out the meaty, oaky flavors. Saddle leather, cherries, and even more smoke on the finish. Tangy, salty, spicy, and malty.

90,Oppidan Smoke + Sea Bourbon,46,Craft Whiskey,40,"Sweet smoke mingles with lemon curd, milk chocolate, roasted marshmallow, and vanilla-frosted yellow cupcake on the nose. The palate has a rubbery peatiness, yet the flavor remains fresh, with cherries and grapes, roasted nuts, salted caramel, and milk chocolate. It all wraps up with the ashiness of pipe tobacco and lengthy saline minerality. Beguiling and moreish—a whiskey worth lingering over. (3,000 bottles)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2018
90,Virginia Distillery Co. Cider Cask Finished Virginia-Highland (Batch 2),46,Craft Whiskey,65,"Malty and biscuity aromas mingle seamlessly with vanilla, plums, raisins, and chocolate-covered bananas. The Highland scotch in the blend asserts itself with dry graininess and a floral character bordering on potpourri, but is well-balanced with cooked plum and pear, chocolate, ginger, and Fig Newton.

90,Larceny,46,Bourbon/Tennessee,25,"Lots of dried fruit, figs, and caramel lead off this bold but balanced bourbon, as dark berry fruits smack of sweet crème de cassis on the palate.

90,Mossburn Signature Casks Series Speyside Blended Malt,46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,40,"This is clever.

90,Heaven’s Door Double Barrel,50,American Whiskey (Unspecified),50,"The additional year of aging in new American oak is readily apparent in this blend of American whiskeys. Dry, toasty, charred oak takes the lead before cherry cough drop, cedar, clove, eucalyptus, and toasted nuts emerge. The red and blue fruits are met with a jolt of spice that will delight rye whiskey fans, before delivering earthy, leathery, tobacco leaf on the finish. Big in oak flavors, but not overdone.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
90,Rossville Union Barrel Proof Rye,56.3,Rye Whiskey,70,"The aroma is a mélange of sweet goodness, with violet candies, figgy dried fruits, and molasses cake that almost evoke a cane-like rum sweetness, as tobacco leaf, leather, and sassafras notes add depth.

90,G. Rozelieures Peaty Collection,46,French Whisky,70,"A little savory at first, with burning leaves and green wood, aromatic spice mix, pastrami, malt loaf, and Worcestershire sauce. Certainly complex and distinctive from a sensory perspective. Initially there is light vanilla sponge, citrus, and brown sugar, but the vanilla grows stronger, combines with malt, and meets an angry surge of pepper. The pepper kicks back to peat smoke and then all is right with the world.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
90,Compass Box Oak Cross,43,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,59,"Compared to Asyla, this has noticeable added richness, fruit, and spice. The nose brings apple danish, creamy custard, honey, citrus peel, and the fragrance of lightly toasted spices. Against a core of rich, tangy fruits, a spicy partnership of pepper and clove manifests under the tongue, stealthily curls around the sides, and storms the palate. The mouth-coating finish drips with mandarin and cooked apple pierced by clove.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,1792 Small Batch,46.85,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"Initially it’s a nut-filled experience with toasted walnuts, pecans, and Brazil nuts, but an atypical spice appears that’s just lovely. Smoked hatch chiles mingle with rounded notes of cinnamon, créme brûlée, Bananas Foster, orange, canned peaches, caramel chew, and toffee. The pepper spices reappear for a grand finish.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
90,BenRiach 25 year old,46.8,Single Malt Scotch,300,"Matured in a mixture of oloroso sherry, bourbon, and virgin oak casks. Honey, vanilla, and tropical fruits on the spicy, aromatic nose, with just a hint of oak. The honey and vanilla carry over to the palate, where they are joined by peaches, drinking chocolate, and subtle sherry. The finish dries steadily, with long-lasting citrus fruit. A stylish, complex dram.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
90,The Macallan Edition No. 3,48.3,Single Malt Scotch,95,"The third release in Macallan’s annual Edition series—which focuses on aspects of cask influence—was matured in a mix of European and American oak casks. Figs and apricot jam, vanilla, Jaffa oranges, and cinnamon on the nose. The palate is silky and offers a big citrus fruit hit, Bit-O-Honey, then creamy milk chocolate. Milk chocolate persists through the long, fruity finish, with attendant sweet oak.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
90,Kavalan Concertmaster,40,Taiwanese Whisky,99,"An effusive offering of dark fruits: cranberry, blueberry, and black currant. This is a beautiful marriage of the spirit and the port cask finishing, showing applesauce, aged oak, macaroons, and dry aromatic spices. Black currant holds sway on the tongue, yielding to caramel, ground ginger, a second burst of juicy blueberry, with a hot finish evoking strips of dried tropical fruit and flashes of ground pepper. Rewarding and flavorsome.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,Bushmills 10 year old,40,Irish Single Malt,44,"This is just a delight; a real flavor giver. A wave of honey sweeps along aromas of creamy vanilla, white peach, fresh citrus peel, white pepper, cinnamon stick, and milk chocolate. It starts delicately with melon, light grape, and vanilla, swells with citrus acidity and creamy caramel, ramping up to toffee, darker fruits, chocolate, Fruit Pastilles, and a little oak. The finish is mouth-clinging, with vanilla and spice.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90, That Boutique-y Whisky Company Blended Whisky No.1 50 year old,46.6,Blended Scotch Whisky,200,"Ovaltine, Whoppers, worn leather, antique furniture, medjool dates, and black fruits on the nose. Sipping this whisky is an unexpected delight. Given the olfactory cues of advanced maturity, it’s surprisingly nimble and still light on its toes. A charming opening of crumble filling with red currant, cranberry, raspberry, and strawberry, joined by apple, pear, and sultana, with peppery spice. Chili heat and spicy finish. (Batch 6; 2,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,The English Single Cask Rum Cask (No. 0471),57.8,World Whisky,156,"A heavily peated whisky finished in a single rum cask. Very smoky with a lot of heat, but a balanced depth. Quite meaty on the palate. Heather honey, supple leather, English peppercorn sauce, and salted vanilla wafers, with incense hanging in the air. Charred apple skins and red berry fruit keep this from being out of balance. Boysenberry, lavender, and smoke on the finish. Very forceful, but complex and intriguing. If beefeaters didn’t already have a drink, they’d probably drink this. (<em>360 bottles; U.S. only</em>)",Adam Polonski,Summer 2018
90,Barrell Bourbon (Batch 015),53.8,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"It opens with a crust of salt and Flintstones vitamins in honey, almond paste, and caramel. Then pumice, pear, canned peaches, and baked apples jump into the mix, followed by Nutella, Cheerios, candied pecans, and chocolate. As the medium to long finish sets in, slight hints of smoke appear and suggest it would pair great with a bold cigar. A drop of water only makes it better.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
90,Barrell Infinite Barrel Project (Feb. 12,"2018), 59.65",Miscellaneous,65,"With smoke and oak, this starts off so intense with pepper spices, peat, dried apricot, hard candies, caramel-covered apples, salted butter, pecan shell, and strawberry jam. Leather, tobacco, and baking spices begin the descent toward a medium, slightly bitter finish. If you like trying new things, this is an American cadre of flavors unlike anything out there. (Bottled on February 12, 2018)",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
90,The Whistler 10 year old How the Years Whistle By,46,Irish Single Malt,55,"The Cooney family opened the Boann Distillery in Ireland’s Boyne Valley in 2016. A little maturity and oloroso finishing fills this whiskey with a more sophisticated air, bringing red fruits, pecan cookies, orange, apple, pear, and some dry, peppery spices. The palate has good weight and a lovely balance; caramel sweetness, orange, crystalized pineapple, butterscotch, and pepper, with a hint of bitter lemon on the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,Kikori,41,Japanese,50,"Get back to nature; this is a whisky to savor during a spectacular sunrise. Lychee, edamame, pea shoots, green apple, and morning dew on lush lawns. As it warms and wakes up, there are hints of orange and some piquant spice. The taste jumps from lemongrass to lemon candies, with melon, mild peppercorn, gentle vanilla, creamy oak, and a few green notes at the end.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,Dingle Single Malt,46.5,Irish Single Malt,77,"Despite some inconsistent spelling of sherry terms on the exterior tube, Dingle is releasing some very good initial whiskeys. The nose brings dates, dried apricot and apple, haystacks, vanilla, unwaxed lemon, and cardamom pod. This second small batch release tastes fruity, with orange lollipops, a beautifully developed apricot note, and caramel, leading to a peak of gingerbread and pepper, followed by vanilla, toffee, and orange oil twisted from the peel. (6,000 bottles) €65",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
90,Doc 52 Straight Bourbon Whiskey,55,Bourbon/Tennessee,50,"On the nose, cherry tart baked over a fireplace: rich red fruit with a whiff of soot and some chalky minerality. A lot of warmth on the palate, with biscotti, almond, toffee, and warm caramel apple topped with sweet vanilla cream, and chocolate ganache on the side. Good, creamy texture, with some sharp peppery tinges. A 9 year old Tennessee bourbon selected by and bottled for Doc’s Wine, Spirits and More in Memphis, Tennessee. (<em>152 bottles</em>)",Adam Polonski,Summer 2018
90,Crown Royal Blender’s Select,45,Canadian,42,"Crown Royal develops its bourbon-like house style by using an American-style mashbill of 64% corn, 31.5% rye, and 4.5% malted barley for one of its many component whiskies. From this single component, blender Mark Balkenende selected mature whisky exhibiting sweet flowers, pear juice, vanilla, fresh grain, mild barrel tones, clean dry wood, brisk spices, and a long, glowing finish. Very floral, fruity, and quaffable. ($55CAD; Ontario only)",Davin de Kergommeaux,Spring 2018
90,Jameson Caskmates IPA Edition,40,Irish Blended Whiskey,30,"Hoppy notes cloaking the crisp grains, green apple, and pomelo make for a happier marriage than its stout sibling. This is one of those whiskeys that continuously evolves in the mouth, progressing from a sweet, syrupy beginning of coconut macaroons, apple, and spices, to a creamier plateau of citrus, stewed fruits, and chocolate. It departs leaving the tongue weighted down with peppery spice and cooked apple. Unexpectedly delicious. <em>Value pick</em>",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Dewar’s 15 year old The Monarch,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,50,"The divine stone fruit aromas are the key to unlocking the nose on this one: apricot, honey, vanilla icing, malt bins, Quaker Oats Squares, and lofty floral top notes. Sweet mandarin, brown sugar, vanilla fudge, strands of finely shredded peel, and more spice than the 12 year old can muster. The sweet vanilla aftertaste is softer and more elegant than the younger expressions.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Michter’s US*1 Toasted Barrel Barrel Finish Rye 2017 Release,55.5,Rye Whiskey,75,"At first, it’s truly American candy: melted chocolate-covered almonds and coconut. Then, it’s cinnamon, toffee, butterscotch, gingersnap cookies, red pepper, and Rice Krispies. This mouth-coating offers lingering baking spices throughout. A drop of water offers even more complexity, with pronounced caramel chew notes developing. With or without water, a complex and long finish awaits with hints of jalapeño chocolate.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
90,1792 Bottled in Bond,50,Bourbon/Tennessee,36,"Think carnival aromas—the good ones, anyway—meeting the campfire. Cracker Jacks, cinnamon-covered almonds, popcorn, cotton candy, marshmallows melting over graham crackers, and hints of smoldering oak. Next, coconut, caramel, and cocoa over a buttery mouthfeel with hints of toffee, banana, baked apple, and pumpkin pie appear. Toward the end, hints of black pepper and raspberry strudel surface in a medium to long finish.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
90,The Balvenie 1981 35 year old,43.8,Single Malt Scotch,"60,000/set","A refill American oak hogshead matured this whisky. The nose offers malt, vanilla fudge, pineapple, and contrasting lemon.

90,BenRiach Authenticus 30 year old,46,Single Malt Scotch,555,"Following on from 21 and 25 year old expressions of Authenticus, BenRiach has now added its oldest variant yet to the lineup. The nose offers orchard fruits, honey, polished oak, and vanilla-tinged peat smoke. Full and fruity on the palate, with sweet peat having a presence, plus milk chocolate and licorice. The finish is relatively long, with citrus fruit, ashy smoke, and a lingering herbal note. <em>£400; Not available in the U.S.</em>",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
90,Bushmills Port Cask Reserve,40,Irish Single Malt,137,"Sweet honey daubed on ripe plums, an abundance of barley notes, black cherry, and a smattering of exotic spices. Juicy notes of cherry, plum, peach, and strawberry, with undertones of peppery spice. The flavor fills out with lovely malty notes, Quaker Oats, and vanilla. The port cask has really complemented the Bushmills character, and this second edition in the Steamship collection is the best in the series to date. (£99; Global Travel Retail only)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Exclusive Malts 2006 (distilled at Linkwood) 11 year old,58.2,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The nose is pleasingly floral, with soft spice, malt, heather in bloom, and even a suggestion of violets. Well textured on the palate, oily and nutty, with tropical fruits, honey, milk chocolate, vanilla, and malt. The finish is lengthy, with a hint of citrus and warming spices. (Cask no. 69; 287 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
90,Gordon & MacPhail 1977 (distilled at Strathisla),48.5,Single Malt Scotch,698,"This 40 year old was matured in a refill American hogshead. Perfumed on the nose, with vanilla, soft leather, lanolin, and lavender. Watery soft fruits on the palate, with cocoa powder and ginger. The finish offers more cocoa powder, black coffee, and licorice-flavored oak. £500 (191 bottles, <em>The Whisky Exchange exclusive</em>)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
90,West Cork Glengarriff Series Peat Charred Cask,43,Irish Single Malt,45,"An innovative approach to flavoring casks by charring the staves with burning peat, this whiskey develops a smoldering nose of dark chocolate brownies, dry wood smoke, and cocoa sweetness. The impact of the peat is confined to the nose, but it tastes pleasantly oily, with tangy citrus, Jolly Rancher hard candy, chocolate cake, spices, fizzy candies, and coffee notes. The finish of nutmeg, cinnamon, clove, and dried peel rounds off an extremely tasty whiskey. (4,800 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Blade and Bow 22 year old 2017 Release,46,Bourbon/Tennessee,200,"This is a re-release of the 2015 bottling. A tapestry of confectionery delights begins this journey, followed by fruit, cigar box, saddle leather, cotton candy, roasted pecans, caramel, and marshmallow. Then, it’s smoked paprika, fig, cinnamon, strawberry, and dark cherries. In the form of walnut shells, a powerful and somewhat pleasant bitterness finds the finish, with a hint of chocolate. But that bitterness does supersede the more pleasant notes, making it slightly unbalanced.",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
90,Bruichladdich Octomore 08.3,61.2,Single Malt Scotch,165,"One of four Octomore 08 Masterclass releases, this was distilled in 2011 from Islay barley peated to 309 ppm. Fifty-six percent of the spirit was matured in first-fill bourbon casks, while the remainder was aged in European oak wine casks. Barbecue smokiness on the nose, with wet peat and citrus fruitiness. On the palate, earthy peat, full-bodied red wine, and milk chocolate. Peat smoke to the fore in the finish, with ginger and chili. (18,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
90,Fuji-Sanroku Small Batch 18 year old,43,Japanese,207,"A little joy from Mount Fuji: soy sauce, five-spice powder, grilled pineapple, halved passion fruit, and the umami sensation of slightly salty umeboshi. It’s dense and mouth-coating, with maple syrup, cinnamon, and a steady build of rye spices, particularly nutmeg and clove, before closing off with dark baked orange. The spices are short lasting, but the pleasurably deep boiled orange candy sweetness persists for minutes. (JPY 22,000; Not available in the U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Lambay Single Malt,40,Irish Single Malt,70,"Spicier and darker than their blend, this delivers heather honey, banana peel, cashew, pepper, ground coriander, and bay leaf. Quite light-bodied and delicate to begin with, but the Cognac cask adds fruitiness and greater complexity. Sugary sweet, with tingly spices, honey, cracked black pepper, clove-studded oranges, and tangy marmalade. A finish of bitter orange, pepper, and fondant cream makes this a worthy addition to the Cognac cask revival.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Prizefight Irish Whiskey,43,Blended Irish Whiskey,45,"Inspired by the Morrissey-Sullivan bout of 1853, this whiskey received a 6 month rye barrel finish which results in enticing toasty notes, cinnamon bark, malt, and vanilla. The structure is light, the flavors are delicious, and it knocks you out with malt, creamy vanilla, active spices, and a dry nuttiness. Give the finish an eight-count for its long lasting spices and good punch of sweetness.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Reisetbauer 15 year old,48,Austrian Whisky,133,"Distilled by Hans Reisetbauer, this is like an amplified version of his 12 year old (see below). Red pears, pomegranate, walnut husks, and more active spices, from mace and asafetida to coriander. The flavors unfurl sedately over the palate like a flower coming into bloom: soft honeyed fruit, pear, raspberry, strawberry, spices, bramble, and chocolate drops. A drying finish of five-spice, dried apple, and chocolate. Best of this Austrian trio.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Sierra Norte Single Barrel Yellow,45,World Whisky,50,"Blue iris, dried chilies, and fresh linen; the corn is sweet and fat, and the aromas integrate more harmoniously than the White and Black expressions. Fresh and fruity, orange marmalade, honey oozing into maple syrup, developing more complexity as the smooth layers shift to accommodate the growing pepper and chili heat ahead of a spicy honey finish. For a 10 month old single cask whiskey, this is remarkably impressive.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
90,Crown Royal Noble Collection Wine Barrel Finished,40.5,Canadian,60,"Until recently, Crown Royal, Canada’s best-selling whisky, took a conservative approach to limited-edition releases. The annual Noble Collection is a promising taste of the innovation underway at the Gimli, Manitoba distillery, which includes experiments with single grain wheat whisky, single malts, and more. This first venture into cask finishing uses Cabernet Sauvignon barrels. It is still Crown Royal, but on top of the bourbonesque vanillas and woody notes, rich red fruits jump from the glass. A new direction that moves Crown Royal into the realm of big, beautiful whiskies. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/18-crown-royal-noble-collection-wine-barrel-finished/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Number 18 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Winter 2017
90,Chivas Regal Ultis,40,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,160,"The first blended malt to carry the Chivas Regal name was created as a tribute to the legacy of the five master blenders, from Charles Howard in 1895 to Colin Scott. Malts from five of Pernod Ricard’s Speyside distilleries (Strathisla, Longmorn, Tormore, Allt-a-Bhainne, and Braeval) were used to create intricate and elaborate flavors. Even more enchanting than the story are the aromas of fresh red apple, cherry, peach, and mango, mingled with cinnamon and dry heather. This luxurious whisky delivers dark vanilla, soft fruits, chocolate-dipped Brazil nuts, and is cloaked in sumptuous layers of caramel, wood spices, and gingersnaps. Outstanding. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/19-chivas-regal-ultis/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Number 19 in the 2017 Top 20 </a></em>",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
90,Benromach Triple Distilled 2009,50,Single Malt Scotch,59,"Benromach’s first triple-distilled single malt was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose offers peaches with a wisp of sweet smoke, vanilla, and a hint of lime. Voluptuous and very sweet on the palate; intense sugary orchard fruits and stem ginger, with the characteristic Benromach peat smoke dialed back. The finish embraces insistent black pepper, nutmeg, and very mild peat. £45",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
90,Blair Athol 23 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),58.4,Single Malt Scotch,460,"This Perthshire single malt was distilled in 1993 and aged in European oak sherry butts. Brittle toffee, black treacle, aniseed, black pepper, and cigar boxes feature on the rich nose. The bold palate yields full, creamy sherry notes, almonds, ginger, old leather, and a slightly savory tang. Long, warming, and peppery in the finish. (5,514 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
90,Bunnahabhain 46 year old Eich Bhana Lìr,41.8,Single Malt Scotch,"7,500","Distilled in 1969, the oldest Bunnahabhain ever released was matured in second-fill sherry butts. The nose yields sweet resin, marzipan, ginger, glacé cherries, a hint of cloves, and red berries. The silky palate features Jaffa oranges, dark chocolate, prunes, and more glacé cherries. The finish dries steadily, with slightly bitter tea, white pepper, a savory note, and quite subtle oak tannins for a dram of this vintage. (198 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
90,GlenDronach Kingsman Edition 1991,48.2,Single Malt Scotch,900,"A nose of bold sherry, worn leather, figs, malt, white pepper, and ginger. Ultimately, a mildly savory note. Full-bodied on the palate, with overripe damsons and more ginger; spicy sherry and dried fruits develop. Medium to long in the finish, with persistent prickly spices, black coffee, and fragrant oak.

90,Macallan 12 year old Double Cask,43,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Two oaks are better than one in this single malt, which marries whiskies matured in sherry-seasoned casks of both American and European oak. The sherry imparts aromas of raisins, figs, hazelnuts, blanched almonds, candied orange peel, and leather. A backbone of vanilla sweetness on the palate supports layers of ginger and white pepper, dark chocolate, leather, raisins, toasted hazelnuts, and orange oil. This Macallan joins the core line between the Sherry Oak and Fine Oak ranges. Warming and rich without being syrupy, it doubles up on accessibility with its balance and remarkably affordable price for its quality and age. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/17-macallan-double-cask-12-year-old/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 17 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2017
90,Angel’s Envy Cask Strength (2017 Release),62.25,Bourbon/Tennessee,200,"Initially, it’s extremely perfume-like, with floral notes often found in fragrances. Then the fruit completely takes over: banana, blueberry, plums, cherry, apple, pear, and quince. Of these, the banana lingers until chocolate and vanilla enter the picture, followed by hints of green pepper and graham cracker. Then, boom, baking spices launch into a lovely medium to long finish.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
90,Smooth Ambler Contradiction Bourbon,50,Craft Whiskey,55,"Generously oaked, with toasty oak drive delivering brown spices and earthy dried apple on the nose. The palate pours sweet and rich, with warm corn porridge underscored with dark molasses and maple flavors. There is a lot to like here, from the boiled peanuts to a spiced palate, as the young, house-made whiskey imparts its verve to the 9 year old Indiana bourbon.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
90,Port Dundas 52 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),44.6,Single Grain Whisky,900,"This 1964 distillate has a nose of rich toffee, weighty oak, allspice, antique hardback books, dried apple, cracker bread, and banana chips. A fairy tale taste of red apple perfection, as if Snow White polished it on her skirt. This ripens to encompass gumdrops and lollipops. Golden syrup, lime zest, caramel, and vanilla bleed into a conclusion of nutmeg, oak, and apple peel. An auspicious moment for grain whisky. (752 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
90,Timorous Beastie 18 year old,46.8,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,108,"Peach, meringue, whole apple, runny honey, vanilla, eucalyptus, and spices that are just about to burn in the pan. Lively and fresh Highland whisky flavor proffering sweet honey, cooked apple dusted with icing sugar, lime zest, and a supportive lift of vibrant spices before diffusing into sugary squares of Scottish tablet. Water accentuates the peppermint in the finish and brings out sugary chocolate-mint flavors. One not to miss.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
90,Ohishi Islay Cask,41.7,Japanese,100,"The legacy of the cask’s history imparts more smoke than peat. It hasn’t overpowered the spirit, but the whisky is light enough to be put in the shade, with singeing smoke, coal dust, vanilla, and asphalt. Sweet rice, vanilla, honey, and warm spices of ginger root and black peppercorn, before a late arrival of peat. Milk chocolate, burnt driftwood, toffee, and a little residual pepper on the finish.

90,Fuji-Sanroku Signature Blend,50,Japanese,44,"Fuji-Gotemba Distillery’s talent for grain whisky is evident here, with a nose of waxy green leaves, whole peppercorn, and fleeting glimpses of lemon peel, lime zest, and white peach amid the airy, floral top notes.

90,J.J. Corry The Gael,46,Irish Blended Whiskey,75,"Chapel Gate whiskey aims to resurrect the lost art of the Irish whiskey bond. This delicious debut is built around parcels of aged single malt and grain sourced from County Louth.

A light, slightly syrupy texture with an underbelly of watermelon and raspberry, this year’s release unwraps peach, nectarine, rhubarb, and custard candy, fruit Life Savers, stewed fruits, red berries, and light citrus.

91,Forty Creek Victory,43,Canadian,75,"Corn and rye whiskies blended with a tad of Villard Noir Starboard wine commemorate Canada’s victory in a battle fought in the War of 1812 where Forty Creek now distills whisky. Toasted oak staves were inserted into half of the fully matured whisky for 2 months.

Flavors of lemon, black pepper, walnut-and-apple chutney, dark chocolate, and a lively hit of green apple make this a satisfying pour—especially at the price.

A similarly spicy finish is balanced by plums and berries, dark chocolate, and oak. A balanced, dessert-like whiskey with beautiful sweet notes and much more.",David Fleming,Winter 2018
91,Glen Fohdry Làn-abaich 21 year old Speyside,47.1,Single Malt Scotch,80,"Though the name means “rich and mellow,” this whisky offers fresh, clean aromas: honeysuckle and lilies; melon, lemon, and lime; hay and grass, a sunlit meadow. Sweet and zingy on the palate, with lemon oil, guava candy, blueberry, strawberry, gentle spice, milk chocolate, and walnuts. More spice on the finish, with polished oak and dried fruit. Well constructed, supple, and easy to enjoy. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
91,Glen Fohdry Aiteal an Òir 12 year old Speyside,47.1,Single Malt Scotch,38,"Honey Nut Cheerios, pistachios, pomegranate, and softly spiced, earthy aromas lead into a rich palate of juicy grapefruit, guava, salted dark chocolate, and toasted nuts, with biscuity and oaky flavors to round things out. Gentle, but well balanced; no need to add water. (<em>Total Wine &amp; More</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
91,Old Forester The President’s Choice (Barrel No. 1),55.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"Lovely concentration of flavors, including whiffs of vanilla cream soda, clover honey, bananas Foster, and a dash of pepper define this selection of barrels by Old Forester president Campbell Brown. Zippy and bright, with lemony verve, peach puree, and warming ginger. The finish smacks of pecan, bitter citrus oil, and peppery spice, with the exquisite oak content in a supporting role. (<em>Available at Old Forester Distillery</em>)",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
91, The Glenrothes Vintage 2004,43,Single Malt Scotch,65,"This was matured in American oak sherry-seasoned casks. The nose offers cherry liqueur, sultanas, fruit spice, honey, and new leather. Vanilla and sweet orchard fruits on the early palate, followed by darker berry fruits, soft oak, and a savory note. Cocoa powder and a wisp of smoke in the medium-length finish. (3,150 bottles for U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
91,Laphroaig Quarter Cask,48,Single Malt Scotch,60,"This expression is aged for approximately 5 years in bourbon barrels before spending a final few months in quarter casks. Characteristic tar, engine oil, and ashy peat on the nose. Oily and full on the palate, with sweet grain notes, cinnamon, seaweed, hot peat, and black pepper. The finish is long and powerful, with persistent peat and chili, plus a sprinkling of sea salt.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
91,High West Double Rye! (Batch 18A23),46,Craft Whiskey,35,"A beautiful rye nose of clove spice, sandalwood incense, warm cinnamon toast, and vanilla sugar leads to a palate that is both creamy and juicy, with abundant apricot, orchard, and citrus fruit; the citrus smacks of ruby-red grapefruit with its hint of bitterness. Shows a good bit of heat and power, as the seamless flavors and well-integrated spice coast through a long finish. The first bottling to include High West’s own-make spirit. Tasted blind against previous batches.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
91,Penderyn Celt,43,Welsh Whisky,60,"No prizes for guessing where the peated Islay quarter casks used for finishing came from, but this beautiful whisky has firm, sooty charcoal smoke, impressive maritime characteristics, and aromas of fresh lemon, mandarin, and buttered toast. Sweet citrus with a buttery mouthfeel, and generous smoke and spice. Beautifully weighted, it ends with darker fruits, chocolate, and spicy smoke on the finish. Love it!",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
91,The Tyrconnell 10 year old Sherry Cask Finish,46,Irish Single Malt,75,"On the nose there are warm, grassy tones wrapped in a blanket of sherry, apple, and sultanas, with a tickle of fine white pepper, lemongrass, scented balms, and poppy seed cake. In the mouth there is apple, cherry, and honey nougat, backed by richer sherry fruits. The flavor develops steadily, with late additions of pepper coinciding with a confluence of sweetness and sherry notes. Baked apple sweetness on the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
91,Kilchoman Loch Gorm 2018,46,Single Malt Scotch,110,"This includes whiskies from nineteen oloroso sherry butts filled in 2007, 2008, and 2011. Medium sherry, orange marmalade, cinnamon, and developing sea salt on the nose. The palate yields more sherry, earthy peat, dark chocolate, honey, and ginger. Fruit spice, sultanas, and charcuterie in the medium to long finish. The best Loch Gorm to date. (15,000 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
91,Nikka from the Barrel,51.4,Japanese,65,"Wonderful to see this portly bottle in U.S. stores at last. An exotic nose, with turned woods, stewed plum, sultana, ground ginger, dried chilies, and black cherry, it oscillates between spice and dark fruits. Rich smoke is packed deep; it’s far from the most dominant aroma. Orange, cherry, mango, and bubble gum  notes are beaten back by a spicy rush of ginger and pepper, the sweetness prevailing over the cloves. <em>Editors&#039; Choice</em>",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
91,Kornog Roc’h Hir,46,French Whisky,150,"Made by the sea in Côtes d’Armor on direct-fired small stills attached to worm tubs, which the French elegantly call condenseurs serpentins. This has smoked fish, iodine, pine forests, driftwood, lemon zest, and clean medicinal qualities rather than peatiness. Waxed lemon, light fudge, lemon bonbons, and vanilla from the bourbon barrels ride a crescendo of pepper and ginger before smoke obscures all before it. A match for any Islay.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
91,Bulleit 10 year old,45.6,Bourbon/Tennessee,40,"Earthy, leathery, and spiced, this bourbon shows nice maturity and polish, evoking a well-worn wood-paneled barroom. The flavors offer good intensity and concentration, striking a nice balance of sweet and savory notes, as spicy cedarwood and cigar box come draped in toffee. Water releases some vivid chocolate, vanilla cream, and clove-studded orange. Nice verve, fine balance, and evident maturity.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
91,Redbreast Dream Cask 32 year old,46.5,Irish Single Pot Still,585,"Bursting with hawthorn, red currant, cherry, pomegranate, baked sugar sweetness, roasted spices, cardamom, dark honey, and plum pudding. This pot still whiskey from 1985 is mouth drawing with fruit flesh and skins, tasting of stewed fruits, baked orange, apple, and pomegranate, with a very fine shimmer of spices that sparkles on the tongue. Adding to their canon of single cask Redbreast releases, this is absolutely smashing. €500",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
91, Port Charlotte 10 year old,50,Single Malt Scotch,65,"Distilled from Scottish barley, this is the first permanent age-statement Port Charlotte bottling. First and second-fill American oak and French wine casks were used for aging. Rock pools, lemon juice, caramel, but little overt peat on the nose. The palate boasts big orchard fruit notes, smoky coconut, and brine. Again, the peat is quite muted. Long and spicy in the drying, peaty finish.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
91,Hyde No. 6 President’s Reserve Sherry Cask Finish,46,Blended Irish Whiskey,50,"Vanilla, dark chocolate, pepper, ground ginger, hard candy, floral blooms, Parma Violets, and dried apple sing from this oloroso sherry butt-finished blend of 18 year old triple-distilled single malt and 8 year old single grain. Syrupy fruit textures with flavors of apricot conserve, the European oak finds harmony with the orchard fruits, gingerbread, and pepper. Mouth-coating, lingering finish of oak and dried banana. (5,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
91,Hyde No. 5 The Áras Cask Burgundy Cask Finish,46,Single Grain Irish Whiskey,48,"Triple distilled in Coffey stills and aged for over 6 years, the black grape, blackberry, dry-roasted spices, and cocoa demonstrate how the 6-month finish was well-judged. A wonderful mouthfeel, the wine notes chasing the vanilla sweetness, fudge, gentle spices, and creamy custard tarts before a finish of chocolate and spiced dark fruit. This is so good, I had to check the bottle to confirm this was grain whiskey. (5,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
91,Daftmill Inaugural Release 2005,55.8,Single Malt Scotch,276,"After 12 years of waiting, Francis Cuthbert has finally released the first bottling of his Daftmill Lowland single malt. The nose is soft and floral, with peaches, walnuts, coconut, warm caramel, and milk chocolate. The palate features cereal, almonds, nougat, and subtle citrus fruits. Drying in the relatively long finish, with subtle oak. Well worth the wait! (629 bottles) £210",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
91,Samaroli Islay 2017 Edition,43,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,176,"Chocolate orange, a sizzle of bacon fat, and dry peat. While this feels less potent than Samaroli’s other Islay offerings, it fits the mood perfectly for a nightcap. The taste buds detect orange, honey, chocolate praline, hazelnut, Oreos, a hint of cocoa, and an underbelly of peat smoke that carries into the finish. A wonderfully rich, smooth digestif that will transport you back to Islay in your dreams.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
91,Jameson Black Barrel,40,Irish Blended Whiskey,37,"Sumptuously rich and intense whiskey emerges from these double-charred casks; a seduction of butterscotch, treacle, toasted nuts, scorched coconut, raisin, and vanilla essence. Secure in its deep-centered sweetness, it revels in caramelized sugar, dark vanilla, pecan nut slice, crème brûlée, peppery spice, and fleshy fruits gloomily submerged in sticky, umber syrups. Memorable for its long, satisfying, toasted aftertaste, heavy on the vanilla and raisins.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
91,Compass Box Spice Tree,46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,65,"The tastiest of their Signature range, this boasts a dry oak and spice nose with fudge, rye bread, and banana interwoven with French oak influences of nutmeg, cinnamon, and ground ginger. As the gentle orange, malt, pear, and apple settle down, little spicy explosions of ginger and pepper detonate, leaving an aftermath of spiced malt, coffee cake, milk chocolate, and cocoa. Such a wonderful flavor trajectory to behold.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
91,Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage 2010,43.3,Bourbon/Tennessee,30,"The dance begins in the open barley fields, with a gust of wind catching grain’s natural aromatic presence. Then cherry blossoms and roasted pine nuts tango for dominance, just before the core notes kick in: caramel chew, malt, cornbread, brown sugar, and chocolate, followed by hints of molasses, cardamom, and gingersnaps. As the finish lingers, it’s clear that this is sippin’ whiskey.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
91,Ardbeg Grooves,46,Single Malt Scotch,110,"The 2018 Ardbeg Day limited-edition bottling includes a proportion of spirit matured in red wine casks which have been heavily charred, leaving deep grooves in the surface of the oak. Fragrant soft smoke, warm leather, and salty red berries on the nose; background charcuterie. The palate offers red berry fruits, vanilla, dense peat smoke, brine, and asphalt. Beach bonfires and black pepper in the sweet finish.",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
91,Bowmore Vault Edition Atlantic Sea Salt (First Release),51.5,Single Malt Scotch,140,"This is the first of four bottlings in the Vault Edition series and was matured in bourbon barrels in the distillery’s famous No.1 Vaults. Nectarines in brine on the nose, with iodine and sweet spices. Medium-bodied on the palate, with peaches, vanilla, salt, and slightly bitter orange. Lingering orange notes in the finish, with cocoa powder and lots of salt. This expression lives up to its name!",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
91,GlenDronach Single Cask #5476,49.9,Single Malt Scotch,418,"The oldest of the fifteen expressions in Batch 16 of GlenDronach’s single cask release program, this cask-strength offering has been matured for 26 years in a Pedro Ximénez sherry puncheon. The nose yields fresh-from-the-oven Christmas cake, cherries, nutmeg, and sweet leather. Viscous on the palate, with dark sherry, raisins, plain chocolate, tangy orange, and caramel. Prickly chili and dates in the long finish. (546 bottles) £310",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
91,Kavalan Sherry Cask,57.1,Taiwanese Whisky,185,"This dark, walnut-colored dram delivers the fabulous first-fill sherry cask characteristics we love: raisin, mixed peel, fruitcake, marzipan, Brazil nut, jellied fruits, and nutmeg. So wonderfully thick and chewy that you need to resist the temptation to pick up a knife and fork. It imparts dark weighty fruit, blackened oak, cooked apple, and a twister of peppery turmoil. Add water liberally to unlock figs, dates, and plums.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
91,That Boutique-y Whisky Company (distilled at Paul John) 6 year old,54.7,Indian Whisky,130,"Definitely one to taste. The nose offers up allspice, moderate peat smoke, pomegranate, dried peel, and ground almonds. The palate is superb; milk chocolate caramels, assertive smoke, and peppercorn, then a slow, warm slide into coffee, cocoa, and licorice, becoming lush and velvety in texture. Paradoxically, the more diluted it becomes, the thicker and more substantial it seems to taste. Long finish of coffee and chocolate. (Batch 4)",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
91,Savage & Cooke Second Glance American Whiskey,44,Craft Whiskey,38,"A sourced whiskey of 95% corn, finished in wine barrels from winemaker Dave Phinney. This makes a super first impression, with Bit-O-Honey candy, eucalyptus, black cherry, cinnamon hearts, violet candies, and sandalwood. The flavors pour layered and complex, with clove-studded orange, flickers of rye spice, and pure, crystalline sweetness balanced with lemony lift. Laser-like spice, sweet caramel corn, and more floral notes dance across the long finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Summer 2018
91,The Whistler 7 year old The Blue Note,46,Irish Single Malt,45,"Voluptuous, fruity nose of lemon meringue pie, Conference pear, and fudge, with floral top notes balanced by aromatic spices. The flavors are focused around orange, pear, and lemon, infiltrated by caramel and hectored by some abiding spice notes of ginger, clove, and pepper. Late gains made by honey and nougat at the end. Lemon sherbet and aniseed frame the conclusion. Superb sourced single malt from Boann Distillery.",Jonny McCormick,Summer 2018
91,Hammerhead 28 year old Czech Single Malt,51.2,World Whisky,350,"Floral, resinous, almost hoppy on the nose, with dusty cedar chest, old leather chair, white pepper, licorice, and an intriguing tangy note, like pickles. The palate’s intense oakiness is tempered by an herbaceous sweetness and integrated spice—cinnamon, cubeb, and allspice, with chalky minerality. There’s a savory and saline quality that lingers into the finish, which is spicy and dry with oak tannins. Distilled in 1989 in what was then Czechoslovakia, using Czech peat, and matured in Czech oak casks. (<em>300 bottles; U.S. only</em>)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2018
91,Johnnie Walker Blue Label Ghost and Rare,46,Blended Scotch Whisky,400,"This is much more muscular than the regular, un-haunted Blue Label. It delivers a multitude of flavors—butter toffee, sweet smoke, citrus peel, and dry spices—tantalizingly peeling off layer after layer, building a slow crescendo to a peak of spices and bitter citrus. Mouth drawing with caramel, apple, pear, and sherbet, a mid-palate of zesty orange and baking spices before topping out with bitter peels, grapefruit, smoke, and sour hard candy.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
91,Dewar’s 30 year old Ne Plus Ultra,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,499,"This Pedro Ximénez-finished blend is the oldest Dewar’s expression available. It offers a deliciously deep nose of chocolate-dipped biscuits, dried fruits, and orange peel. The palate includes indulgent rewards of berry fruit, chocolate praline, raspberry, cherry, dried cranberry, and hazelnut. It remains succulent throughout, the sherry fruit keeping the upper hand over the chocolate and batting away the occasional coffee note. A dry finish with nutty chocolate and roasted spice. (<em>Global Travel Retail only</em>)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
91,Ardbeg Twenty Something,46.3,Single Malt Scotch,550,"This 23 year old expression was released for the Ardbeg Committee. It includes whisky matured in sherry and bourbon casks. Sweet asphalt, bonfire smoke, lemon sponge drizzled in iodine, and background cinnamon on the nose.

91,Benromach 1977,56,Single Malt Scotch,"1,735","This 39 year old was matured in a single refill American hogshead. Orange Jujubes on the early nose, with vanilla, honey, and linseed.

91,Kilchoman 2009 Vintage,46,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Matured in a combination of oloroso sherry butts filled in 2008, and bourbon barrels filled in 2008 and 2009. The nose is initially flinty, with lemongrass, fabric Band-Aids, fudge, and vanilla. Ultimately the lemon is joined by Jaffa orange juice. Supple and sweet on the palate, with developing nutmeg and white pepper. Peppery in the finish, with plain chocolate and aromatic peat smoke. (840 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
91,Exclusive Malts Irish 2003 13 year old,54.2,Irish Single Malt,125,"A great discussion whiskey for a themed tasting, this has a comforting nose of vanilla, malt, barley sugar, and creamed-coconut macaroons, with hints of nutmeg and grated chocolate. The palate brings fruity satsuma, barley sugar, and an explosion of pepper, ginger, and licorice. The tangy citrus subsides, replaced by ground almond and stewed rhubarb. Dry heat and hot pepper finish that makes you feel like you could breathe fire. (Cask no. 504; 278 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
91,Green Spot Chateau Montelena,46,Irish Single Pot Still,100,"From Calistoga, California to County Cork, this zinfandel-finished whiskey has bramble, damson jam, red apple, and glacé cherry, with cake mix, flaked almonds, and a steel-tipped edge of spice. Red apple, lemon peel, pithy orange, and crunchy red apple, teasing spice, with just a suggestion of mint mingled into the dry, spicy finish. First Saint-Julien, then Napa; where will Green Spot take our taste buds next?",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
91,The Temple Bar 10 year old,40,Irish Single Malt,64,"Bright citrus, zested lime, grapefruit peel, crystalized fruits, malted biscuits, and oak, overlaid with dry spice notes of nutmeg and cinnamon bark. A creamy, malty palate yields to an initial spicy base layer. When the spices step aside, there is dried orange, fudge sweetness, and chocolate orange. Tangy, concentrated orange, with spices fraying from the edges completes the finish.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
91,Cotswolds 2014 Odyssey Barley,46,Single Malt English Whisky,55,"It’s quite a tick list for their first single malt: 100% locally grown floor-malted barley, long fermentations, unusual yeast strains, innovative distillation cuts, and bourbon and shave-toast-rechar red wine casks. Honey, sugar-sprinkled shortbread, peach tarts, marzipan fruits, glacé apricot, finely shredded citrus peel, and young pink rhubarb. Flavors of heather honey, chili flakes, Christmas spices, caramelized sugar, malt; then marmalade, dried red fruits, and cappuccino. A great all-rounder. More please!

91,The Dalmore Port Collection 1996 Vintage,45,Single Malt Scotch,592,"Dalmore launched a trio of vintages finished in tawny port pipes.

91,High West Campfire,46,Miscellaneous,70,"An oddball that crosses the divide between American whiskey and scotch by literally mixing the two, Campfire combines straight Indiana rye, straight Indiana bourbon, and peated blended malt scotch, marrying them together in heavily toasted French and Hungarian oak wine barrels. The scotch adds hearty, meaty flavors to the dry, spicy, and rich bourbon and rye. This is a robust and beefy whiskey, with smoke reminiscent of Southern barbecue. Earlier releases of this ambitious whiskey didn’t quite hit the mark. Now, it’s right on target. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/14-high-west-campfire/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 14 in the 2017 Top 20</a></em>",Adam Polonski,Winter 2017
91,Tyrconnell 16 year old,46,Irish Single Malt,100,"Most Irish whiskey consumed in the U.S. is blended, and Ireland’s single pot still whiskeys enjoy a cult following. However, Irish single malts, including Tyrconnell 16 year old, are often unfairly overshadowed by their Scottish neighbors. This limited-edition whiskey, made entirely with Irish barley, is double distilled in pot stills like most scotch, then aged in bourbon barrels. Tyrconnell is named for a racehorse, but this whiskey is slow and steady: it’s soft and gentle, yet full-flavored, with warming vanilla, graham cracker, and citrus notes, and rounded spice. Though it may not be as brash as some scotch malts, this thoroughbred is able to go the distance. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/16-tyrconnell-16-year-old/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Number 16 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>",Adam Polonski,Winter 2017
91,Sheep Dip Islay Blended Malt,40,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,60,"Deftly blending the power and grace of popular Islay malts, this whisky offers a sizzle of bacon fat, thick clods of peat, cocoa, and breezy smoke on the nose. The rounded palate has sweet satsuma, swathes of toasted spice, sweeping malty notes, delicious chocolate, and burnt caramel. The wafting smoke builds formidably, until it engulfs the back of the palate. Sheep Dip whisky may have been around since the 1970s, but this latest creation maps out the best of modern Islay styles to great effect. A triumphant, approachable blend that shows great strength of purpose, yet remains full of charm. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/13-sheep-dip/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 13 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
91,Royal Salute Special Batch 21 year old Polo Edition,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,145,"A pedigree blend gracing your glass with aromas of sultana, prune, glacé cherry, toffee, nutmeg, dense dark fruits, sweet toffee, and cozy Christmas spices.

91,Rock Oyster Sherry Edition,46.8,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,60,"The salty coastal twang meets the sherry head on, revealing mandarin, gingerbread, glazed ham, clove, seashells, and driftwood bonfires built on pebble beaches. Smoke comes to dominate the sherry. Orange oils precede a delayed ignition of the spices. More honeyed sweetness comes through, while a smothering layer of peat rises up. Warm spicy finish, until a thick curtain of smoke closes it down. But hey, this rocks.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
91,"Little Book ""The Easy,"" 60.2%",,American Blended Whiskey,80,"It opens with dark chocolate, coffee, hazelnut, leather, earth, cornbread, and maple syrup. Then it pops with brown-sugar butter melting over grits, but the iron skillet cornbread reappears with a dominating and pleasing malt note. Hints of dill, parsley, and roasted almonds come next. Toward the end, a burst of vanilla hits before a long finish with a hint of honey. As American blends go, this is a fantastic pour.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
91,Kentucky Peerless Straight Rye,53.7,Rye Whiskey,125,"Delivering a buttery mouthfeel with toasted rye and baking spice notes, Peerless is the only craft producer on our list. It’s hard to pinpoint why this young rye succeeds where others fail, but one point of difference is the use of sweet mash fermentation, rather than the much more common sour mash technique, where spent mash is added to the new fermentation. Furthermore, the Peerless warehouse achieves temperatures upward of 110 degrees. Whatever the technical reasons, Peerless is paving the way and we expect more craft distillers to join them. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/15-kentucky-peerless-straight-rye/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 15 in the 2017 Top 20</a></em>",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
91,Kentucky Peerless Straight Rye,53.7,Craft Whiskey,125,"Peerless Distilling’s first whiskey in nearly a century; at 2 years old, it’s precocious. Captivating on the nose; fruit-driven, with orange, peach nectar melded with vanilla custard, and nice details of clove and nutmeg. The palate pours big and bold, bursting with fruit alcohol and a face slap of spicy, peppery rye. While it’s a touch hot, the reveal of 53.7% makes this forgivable. A generous splash of water unleashes more flavor, baking spice, and aniseed on the finish.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
92,Knappogue Castle 12 year old Marchesi di Barolo Wine Cask-Finished,46,Irish Single Malt,80,"Baked plum desserts, sweet cherry, star anise, and dark vanilla on the nose, with an enticing freshly toasted spiciness. Caramel, plum, pomegranate, and rawhide shoelaces shift into a concentrated fruitiness as allspice and pepper well up, yielding a sweet core of graham crackers, marshmallows, and creamy vanilla, with hints of chocolate. Bruised fruit and throbbing spices characterize the finish on this laudable example of wine finishing. (1,020 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
92,Knappogue Castle 12 year old Marco De Bartoli Marsala Cask-Finished,46,Irish Single Malt,80,"Aromas of green apples, zested lime, and caramel entice the senses with hints of banana peel and nuts. Succulent green apple, honey, and vanilla, this has a thick, syrupy, mouth-drawing palate. Baked pear and peppery spices continue into the finish.

There’s also orange blossom, pecans, cedar chest, and tobacco. Aromas and flavors unfold in layers, with rich oak, roasted pecans, and vanilla whipped cream juxtaposed against peppery spice, blueberry-cinnamon crumble, and sweet tea. Water reveals new depths.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Fall 2019

92,Domaine des Hautes Glaces 100% Organic Rye (Cask #79),53.1,French Whisky,90,"Explore the layers of this malted rye. It is herbaceous and minerally throughout, with aromas of licorice, chamomile, ginger, tarragon, incense, cooked pears, bread dough, cinnamon, and soil. The flavors express grain, minerals, and earth—tarragon, licorice, peppercorn, roasted peaches, walnut shells, and assertive but not overpowering oak. This young whisky’s flavors are from the field, fermenter, and still, not the barrel. Unique, complex, and exciting. (450 bottles)",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2018
92,Cladach,57.1,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,198,"Sun-bleached driftwood, iodine, curry spices, and hot asphalt, with a highly charged, aromatic smokiness: a combination of peat kiln and crackling moorland blaze. There is serenity too, with soft cream, ripe citrus, and key lime pie. Thick and glossy, it’s an intense, mouth-puckering, cask-strength prospect. Chocolate, cinnamon, and mint collide with a barrage of clove and barrel char. Booming spices reverberate in the grip of an extremely long finish. £155",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018

92,Michter’s 10 year old Single Barrel Bourbon (Barrel #18B202),47.2,Bourbon/Tennessee,120,"There’s evident age here, with dried leaves, old suede jacket, and dusty oak at the forefront, but underlying that maturity is plenty of dried fruit, figs, and cola. It pours broad and mouth filling, exuding both power and grace as it delivers caramel, tobacco, and a mélange of baking spices—cloves and nutmeg. The solid wood structure and oak tannins are here in abundance, but never out of balance.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018

The nose yields vanilla, oats, ripe pears, and mild wood-fire embers. Supple and initially sweet on the palate, with icing sugar, tangerines, and developing darker, spicier notes. Lengthy in the finish, with spicy cedar oil. Proof that Highland Park doesn’t need sherry casks to be good. (4,500 bottles for U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018

92,Wilderness Trail Settlers Select Single Barrel Kentucky Straight Barrel Proof Rye,48.5,Craft Whiskey,62,"Orange, banana, and nutmeg lead on the nose, along with a subtle note of cigar box. A smooth, chocolaty palate melds with maple syrup, caramel, allspice, and more tobacco. Water brings out heat and more spiciness, with orange and chocolate notes reprising on a long finish.

Imagine Dylan’s Candy Bar did a pop-up at Sephora and you’ll get the idea.

Then a spice backbone jumps out, followed by butterscotch, brown sugar, vanilla wafers, jalapeño cornbread, mustard seeds, and peach cobbler.

92,Compass Box No Name,48.9,Blended Scotch Whisky,125,"Peatheads, listen up! Yes, there’s pine needles, zested lemons, honey, sanded wood, nutmeg, and cinnamon within this Islay-dominated blend, but it’s the billowing peat smoke that makes this special. It reeks gloriously of stacked fish boxes and heavy braided ropes on the pier. The dark fruit, baked lemons, cherry, clove, and cooked plum face entanglement in a labyrinth of shadowy stygian smoke.

Less sweet than expected, Entrapment goes straight to long-evolved high esters, dried figs and dates, green fruits, and soaring fruity floral notes. Its spicy finish lasts forever.

92,Amrut Double Cask Batch 3,46,Indian Whisky,165,"The dark chestnut liquid results from maturation in bourbon and port casks, and it has an equally enticing nose: squishy prunes, dried fig, blackcurrant, sour cherry, apple tarts, and nutmeg.

92,Glen Moray 18 year old,47.2,Single Malt Scotch,90,"The relentless upward march of prices for well-aged scotch is discouraging to veteran whisky drinkers and newcomers alike. At just $90, this lovely Speyside 18 year old hearkens back to the good old days of single malt. A warm, soft, and rounded whisky, with pleasing melon and apricot flavors, hints of dried hay and apple pie à la mode, and a backbone of peppery fruit and malt, Glen Moray 18 year old isn’t about bombast. It balances delicacy and strength rather than embracing raw power. Although it’s celebrating its 120th anniversary this year, Glen Moray isn’t very well known in the United States, but that may be about to change. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/10-glen-moray-18-year-old/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 10 in the 2017 Top 20</a></em>",Adam Polonski,Winter 2017

But Rebel Yell 10 year old Single Barrel scores on both counts. The 2017 release presents stellar caramel and vanilla notes, then pure bliss, striking powerful mouth-coating notes of crème brûlée with a beautiful pecan pie note on the finish. Since these are single barrels, flavors may vary by bottle; no two barrels yield identical flavors. However, Rebel Yell 10 year old has come pretty close to a house style, and that sort of consistent excellence in a single barrel whiskey is an achievement in itself.

92,"Little Book “The Easy,” 60.2%",,American Blended Whiskey,80,"By focusing exclusively on high-quality straight whiskeys, without neutral spirits, Little Book is a fine example of America’s new era of blends. It includes all straight whiskeys: 4 year old bourbon, 13 year old corn, 5 year old 100% malt, and 5 year old rye. Like Booker’s bourbon, Little Book is uncut and unfiltered, to preserve the full flavor. The dominant note, cornbread, still allows the malt’s sweetness and the rye’s spice to come through.

93,Laphroaig Triple Wood,48,Single Malt Scotch,70,"Initially aged in bourbon barrels before being transferred into quarter casks, and ultimately oloroso sherry butts. The sherry influence adds an additional dimension to the quarter-cask style, hence an oily nose of dates, vanilla, tropical fruits, and bonfire smoke. The palate is drier than might be expected, with Laphroaig iodine, barbecued meats, muted sherry, and peat smoke. The finish comprises dried fruits and lots of oak.",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
93,Knob Creek Cask Strength Rye,59.8,Rye Whiskey,70,"Dripping with caramel and tingling with spice, this is a blockbuster whiskey that delivers across a spectrum of flavors. Maple syrup, sugar in the raw, and caramel-drizzled flan highlight the aroma, while the palate turns fruity and tropical with the sweet drive of peach nectar, grilled fruits, and pineapple upside-down cake. At the same time, it’s lemony bright, warmly spiced, tremendously rich, and oh-so-good! Pour on the water and enjoy the ride!",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018

Flavors explode on the palate, with more herbal complexity, root beer barrel candy, green almond, black cherry, and a big rush of dark, bitter-sweet burnt sugar and caramel. Lovely baking spices and lots of toasty oak linger on the long finish. The youngest barrel in the blend is just over 6 years, 2 months of age. <em>Editors’ Choice</em>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Fall 2018
93,Black Snake Vat 6 Third Venom,60.2,Single Malt Scotch,100,"A beguiling nose of raisins, dried figs, hazelnuts, white chocolate, brown sugar, and candied ginger, with a rich meatiness that calls to mind braised pork with stewed plums. The palate sings with classic sherry flavors: figs, almonds, hazelnuts, dark chocolate, white pepper, orange peel, and a lithe minerality. As might be expected given the ABV, water may be added with impunity. From an undisclosed Highland distillery, matured in a modified solera system and finished in a PX cask.

93,Big Peat 25 year old,52.1,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,236,"Peat has grown up to become the best version of himself that he can be. The mellow, sweet smoke makes all your cares drift away. It’s like walking on an Islay beach through seaweed stranded at the high-tide mark. Lemon lozenges, Sweethearts, flashes of citrus, stewed apple, and growing smoke.

The mouthfeel is flowing and silken, radiating flavors of golden syrup, tangerine, peppercorn, vanilla, light oak, and nougat. As the flavor crests, the sweetness is evocative of Château D’Yquem.

In the mouth, it’s incredibly smooth and glossy; quite honeyed, subtle soft fruits, raspberry, apple, mixed peel, butterscotch, baked orange, and a hearty spice core. A creamy finish, where the spices outlast the fruit.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
93,Dewar’s 25 year old,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,225,"Aged for a quarter century and finished in Royal Brackla casks? Count me in. The nose is highly attractive; a rich maltiness unfolds with vanilla oak, flapjacks, whole almonds, and gentle background spices.

93,Elijah Craig Barrel Proof (Batch C917),65.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,65,"When complex spice meets complex caramel, it makes for a wonderful American whiskey experience.

93,Compass Box Spice Tree Extravaganza,46,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,140,"Following the Spice Tree recipe of 60% Clynelish, 20% Dailuaine, and 20% Teaninich, Extravaganza’s core was matured for more than four additional years in light/medium toast, refill, and heavy toast hybrid casks of American and French oak. Finally, sherry-matured Glen Ord, Benrinnes, and Allt-a-Bhainne were added to the mix. The elaborate process is typical of maverick blender John Glaser, but it’s his results that count. Flavors of peanut brittle, toasted coconut, and pale, light sherry translate into a delicious honeyed palate of caramelized sugar, red apple, and red berry fruit. Ginger and clove provide further rigor before a finish of incendiary spices. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/7-compass-box-spice-tree-extravaganza/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 7 in the 2017 Top 20</a></em>",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017

93,Ardbeg An Oa,46.6,Single Malt Scotch,60,"Ardbeg doles out occasional limited releases for their avid fans, but for nearly a decade the core range consisted of just three whiskies: 10 year old, Uigeadail, and Corryvreckan. The addition of An Oa, matured in a combination of virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez sherry, and bourbon barrels, and married in a French oak ‘gathering vat’ prior to bottling, marks a reason to celebrate. An Oa is a more approachable Ardbeg. It lacks some of the typical oiliness, but flavor and complexity abound with hot peat, black tea, and peppery cloves.

93,Tamdhu Batch Strength 002,58.5,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Historically used for blending, Tamdhu flies under the radar of many scotch aficionados. But this underappreciated Speyside whisky compares well with more famous sherry bombs by offering a sweet, savory, slightly funky depth. At first sniff, Tamdhu seems like it might knock you out with one blow—but this gentle giant is a lover, not a fighter. Viscous and meaty, this cask-strength stunner reveals dried fruit, dark chocolate ganache, ginger spice, and saline minerality, thundering softly into a long finish. Ian Macleod Distillers revived Tamdhu, and their pledge to bring Rosebank back to life excites us to rediscover more top-quality whisky with a distinct identity. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/8-tamdhu-batch-strength-002/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 8 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>",Susannah Skiver Barton,Winter 2017

Among the tangle of spices, tasters identified chili pepper, allspice, cloves, and universally adored its ginger note. Finally, wisps of smoke and sea salt. Overall, it feels generously malty, with the grain whisky lending broad sweetness and supple mouthfeel across the long finish.



Beyond its delightful flavors, Nikka From the Barrel presents some paradoxes worthy of contemplation over a glass. It is a classic, yet new to the U.S. It is typically Japanese, yet singularly magnificent. It is delightful sipped neat and also blossoms with water. Even the simple, squat bottle is in contrast to the profound complexity within. (Fortunately, the 500 ml bottle offered in other markets received a supersizing for U.S. drinkers.)



The great majority of new Japanese whiskies now arriving to our shores are so rare and so expensive that they seem intended only for elite whisky lovers.

Very persistent tangy citrus fruits through the extremely long finish. No negative tannic notes. (74 bottles)",Gavin Smith,Summer 2018
94,King of Kentucky 14 year old,62.5,Bourbon/Tennessee,200,"Simply beautiful. It’s so complex, with notes of molasses, apple butter, toffee, salt water taffy, hazelnut, burnt brown sugar, crème brûlée, caramel flan, butterscotch, crystallized ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, fenugreek, roasted almonds, and marshmallow. With a drop of water, another complex layer forms with cotton candy and burnt pie crust. In both cases, it finishes extremely long.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
94,Compass Box Phenomenology,46,Blended Scotch Whisky,180,"The nose has honey, caramelized apples, Pixy Stix, pears in cream, faint pepper, ground coriander, and salty driftwood. It’s teeth-coating with golden syrup sugariness, the silky texture meting out pears, apples, sweet barley notes, and crunchy spices, before a vanilla phase gives way to black pepper, licorice, and smoke. Mouth-numbing finish of long-active spices over vanilla. (7,908 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
94,Redemption 18 year old Straight Rye,54.95,Rye Whiskey,400,"This sings a tune of balance, with caramel, coconut, chocolate, barrel char, and campfire smoke harmonizing at the opening. Next comes an amazingly complex series of herbal notes: dill, oregano, and thyme. That’s when cinnamon bread, coffee, and crème brûlée take over; each note super concentrated and rounded. The long finish presents a hint of cinnamon. This is a must-have sipper. (450 bottles)",Fred Minnick,Spring 2018
94,Wild Turkey Master’s Keep Decades,52,Bourbon/Tennessee,150,"Wild Turkey often exhibits a delightful earthiness, and when earth meets sweet in whiskey, it’s a beautiful thing. Wild Turkey Master’s Keep Decades achieves a rich texture where deep-tilled soil, fresh-cut grass, and mushrooms meet leather and dark chocolate, followed by dill, oregano, and oak. Caramel and vanilla explode over a heavy dose of cinnamon. Master distiller Eddie Russell mingled barrels ranging from 10 to 20 years old in order to strike this balance and complexity. His method displays the potential of combining extremely old stocks into batches with younger barrels to build a great whiskey. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/3-wild-turkey-masters-keep-decades/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 3 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
94,Four Roses Limited Edition Small Batch (2017 Release),53.95,Bourbon/Tennessee,130,"This is an ode to this bourbon’s old-school style that, post-caramel and cinnamon, is balanced with dried blueberries, sweet cornbread, nutmeg, saffron, citrus, and slight hints of chipotle, ginger, and clove. Under the beautiful spice come vanilla cake batter, almond butter, and salt water taffy that walk it to a finish that just doesn’t quit. It’s the vanilla-forward finish that makes this an upper-echelon whiskey. (13,800 bottles for the U.S.)",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
94,George T. Stagg (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2017),64.6,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"Caramel. Caramel. Caramel. It comes early and remains to the finish. In between this caramel sandwich, it’s nutmeg, cinnamon, jasmine, rose petals, baked apples, fudge, pecan pie, peanut brittle, and roasted peanuts. Over a mouth-coating palate, its complexity tingles and every note plays just under the rich and layered caramel that presents itself as a chew on the extremely long finish. This is a must-have sipper.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
94,Glenmorangie Astar 2017,52.5,Single Malt Scotch,100,"The first bottling of Astar was released in 2008. The 2017 release was matured in casks made of oak from Missouri’s Ozark Mountains. The nose is floral, with rosehips, orange blossom, and milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. Honey and citrus notes follow. Voluptuous on the palate; sweet, even sugary fresh fruit notes, plus vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves. Drying from coconut to plain chocolate in the lengthy finish. Extremely accomplished. (<i>Individual reviewer rating: 93</i>)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
94,Glenmorangie Astar 2017 Release,52.5,Single Malt Scotch,100,"Glenmorangie Astar returns after a five-year absence. Astar is matured in custom toasted casks made from slow-growing trees on north-facing slopes in the Ozark Mountains of Missouri. The barrels harbor bourbon for four years before heading to Glenmorangie. That level of provenance doesn’t come cheap, which is why the original Astar was discontinued in 2012, just four years after its acclaimed appearance. The exquisite Glenmorangie aromas and flavors—floral, with rose hips and orange blossom—are dialed up to new levels of intensity, while the voluptuous and sweet palate exudes harmony and balance. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/2-glenmorangie-astar-2017-release/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 2 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
94, Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),56.5,Single Malt Scotch,130,"This is the 15<sup>th</sup> Special Releases bottling of Lagavulin 12 year old. Matured in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is smoky, with kippers, charcuterie, and bonfire embers, offset by berry fruits. On the unctuous palate, smoke blends with vanilla, green apples, and licorice, plus pepper and sea salt. Peppery, ashy peat in the lengthy finish. (<i>Individual reviewer rating: 91</i>)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
94,Lagavulin 12 year old (Diageo Special Releases 2017),56.5,Single Malt Scotch,130,"Conventional wisdom suggests that Lagavulin is at its peak at 16 years of age. However, this superlative 12 year old confirms why many consumers like their Lagavulin younger. This is Lagavulin at its very best: bold, yet complex and satisfying; full of character, with smoky, savory, maritime, sweet vanilla, and fruit notes all merging into a balanced and eminently drinkable whole. It takes a few drops of water well, releasing burnt grass aromas and more palate sweetness. The Diageo Special Releases are not known to be bargains, but this Lagavulin is sensibly priced, and the greatest all-around value from the 2017 lineup. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/4-lagavulin-12-year-old-diageo-special-releases-2017/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 4 in the 2017 Top 20</a> </em>",Gavin Smith,Winter 2017
94,Amrut Greedy Angels 8 year old,50,Indian Whisky,285,"Rejoice! Those greedy angels have left sufficient liquid behind in the Amrut warehouse for a new release. Chocolate ganache, dark fudge, rye bread, toasted fennel seed, overripe mango, lavender, and parma violet aromas. It’s divine: chocolate brownie, orange peel, espresso, bramble, candied fruit jellies, toffee, and blackened oak, with a finish of fruity chocolate. Repay such celestial avarice by acquiring some of this heavenly whisky for yourself. (180 bottles for the U.S.)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
94,Elijah Craig Barrel Proof B517,62.1,Bourbon/Tennessee,60,"As bourbon matures in new charred oak barrels over time, it approaches a perilous point when the oak dominates the flavor. To sip Elijah Craig at 12 years of age—at full barrel proof, without dilution or filtering—is to taste bourbon at its apex, so dangerously close to going over the crest of the hill, yet delivering a massive mouthful of incredibly robust flavors that drape leathery oak over a gooey caramel core, sprinkled with baking spice, while candied nuts and tobacco leaf notes appear on a drying finish dusted with cocoa. <em><a href=""/top20/2017/1-elijah-craig-barrel-proof-b517/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Number 1 in the 2017 Top 20 </a></em>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2017
94,Collectivum XXVIII (Diageo Special Releases 2017),57.3,Blended Malt Scotch Whisky,164,"An incredibly complex creation using stock from Diageo’s 28 operational single malt distilleries, this has minted toffee, gummy bears, raw gooseberry, fresh whole grain bread, and earthy spices shaken over sweet banoffee pie. Rich fruit, cocoa, granular white chocolate, dark citrus, waxy caramel bars, nutmeg, cinnamon, and bitter dark chocolate. Water stimulates green fruit notes. A beautiful sugared almond note materializes with sweet fudge and dried apple dipped in chocolate. £125",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2017
95,Redbreast 20 year old Dream Cask Pedro Ximénez Edition,52.5,Irish Single Pot Still,415,"Following one of 2018’s most collectible releases, this vatting of four mature pot still whiskeys finished in a PX butt is quite a departure for Redbreast. The nose has incredible depth, with dark, sticky, concentrated black cherry, candied peel, coriander leaf, vanilla, allspice, clove, and whole almond. This heavy, unctuous, mouth-coating whiskey resonates with rich fruits, clove, licorice, and juicy blackberry, ending with pot still spice and bitter notes. (924 bottles) €380",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2019
95,Uncle Nearest 1820 Single Barrel 11 year old Tennessee Whiskey (Barrel US-2),55.1,Bourbon/Tennessee,119,"This is mature whiskey at its most refined: a balance of fruits, nuts, sweetness, and restrained oak. The nose has it all: salted, buttered pecans, rock candy, Dr. Pepper, blackberry jam, dried blueberries, caramel corn, tobacco barn, and old leather chair. It’s practically dessert-like in the mouth, with dark chocolate-covered caramel, candied pecans, Goo Goo Clusters, cherry cola, blackberry and blueberry jam, and a kiss of white pepper. The finish stays consistent, a mouthwatering mélange of caramel, chocolate, and nuts. Harmonious, seamless, and silky—you’d never guess the proof.",Susannah Skiver Barton,Summer 2019
95,Uncle Nearest 1820 Single Barrel 11 year old Tennessee Whiskey (Barrel US-1),57.55,Bourbon/Tennessee,119,"A glass of this whiskey starts with a fragrant nose of honey blossom, wild strawberries, vanilla custard, and a dusting of cocoa powder. The palate is a complex mélange of cherries, blueberries, blackberries, mango, and orange marrying with dark chocolate, baking spice, lush oak, aged tobacco leaf, and a light espresso note. More richness and complexity on a delicious finish of chocolate, blackberry jam, walnuts, and coconut shavings.",David Fleming,Summer 2019
95,Mister Sam Tribute,66.9,Canadian,250,"The first annual release of Sazerac’s finest old Canadian and American whiskies blended at barrel strength. The nose presents memories of long-closed whisky warehouses, old books, and artist’s oil paint. Prunes, dates, figs, chocolate-covered cherries, a cobbler’s shop, vague cloves, lilacs, brown sugar, and warming spices on the palate. Ultra-complex, rich, creamy, and fruity. Hot and mouth-watering with billows of vanilla, creamy caramel, and mincemeat. (1,200 bottles for the U.S. and Canada only) <em>Collectible</em>",Davin de Kergommeaux,Summer 2019
95,Chivas Regal The Icon,43,Blended Scotch Whisky,"3,500","A spectacular citrus nose with incredible freshness; neroli oil, bergamot orange, an array of wood spices, baked apricot, dried strawberry, heather, lavender, honeysuckle, jasmine, and hyacinth. An intense array of citrus on the palate—the strongest being mandarin, it is thick-textured yet agile—accompanied by baked brioche, Ling heather honey, vanilla, and oak, with a hint of eucalyptus on the extraordinarily long finish. A masterclass in rare whisky blending.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2019
95,Midleton Barry Crockett Legacy,46,Irish Single Pot Still,260,"This is mastery of American oak! Polished wood, cinnamon cereals, dry spices of pepper, allspice, and paprika, and a riot of mostly overripe fruit: custard apple, mango, brown banana, baked apricot dessert, and fresh fig. Caramel, date slices, treacle, and cracker bread flavors are bathed in feisty pot still spices and fleeting green apple, before a lush, rich sweetness of banoffee pie, vanilla, and cinnamon descends. The finish is seemingly eternal.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
95,George T. Stagg 15 year old (2018 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection),62.45,Bourbon/Tennessee,99,"This offers up warming ginger, candied orange, and wisps of furniture polish. The lavish and leathery oak flavors are apparent but don’t overwhelm the abundance of zippy, bright citrus—orange oil and yuzu—as the palate unleashes wave upon wave of spices that keep you guessing where it will head next. In the end, more lingering ginger and dusty cocoa.",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
95,Highland Park 50 year old,42.5,Single Malt Scotch,"15,000","The nose of this veteran is hugely enticing; rich, with old leather, soft spices, sultanas, figs, polished oak, and dunnage warehouses. Tangy orange develops in time. The orange carries over onto the palate—amazingly vibrant and youthful fruitiness—followed by soft toffee, woodsmoke, and a sprinkling of dusty oak. The finish is extraordinarily long, with licorice and fruit-laden old oak. A true classic! (77 bottles in U.S.)",Gavin Smith,Winter 2018
95,Carsebridge 48 year old,43.2,Single Grain Scotch,959,"Sure, the oldest of this year’s Diageo Special Releases manifests the brown-and-orange world of 1970 incarnate, but it does so in glorious fashion. Golden and warm, dessert-like, with bread-and-butter pudding, spun sugar, plenty of oak character, lavender honey, golden puff pastry, perfumery scents, and the first fruits plucked from the orangerie. Quite simply the grooviest thing to come out of Alloa this year. (1,000 bottles)",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
95,Redbreast Cask Strength 12 year old (Batch B1/17),58.6,Irish Single Pot Still,80,"The latest release pits plum, damson, fruitcake, and rosehip against wild, untamed pot still spices straining at the leash. Clove vociferously trumps raisin as the mouth-drawing power is realized; spices deflect off the tongue’s surface like sparks off an anvil. As its grip slackens, the fruit ripens, bruising slightly, yet sweetening deliciously, and vanilla pod, toasted stave, and cinnamon bark emerge. I swear you feel more Irish with every sip. <em>Editors’ Choice</em>",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
95,Crown Royal Noble Collection 13 year old Blenders’ Mash,45,Canadian,60,"If Canada made bourbon (it doesn’t), it would taste like this massive dram. The mashbill of 60% corn, 36% rye, and 4% malted barley is identical to that used for Crown Royal Hand Selected Barrel Coffey rye. Beer still distillation and virgin oak barrels yield huge vanillas, rye spices, barrel tones, cherries, dark fruits, soaring floral esters, and gingery, peppery spices. Strong woodiness, slightly pulling tannins, and something almost chocolaty.",Davin de Kergommeaux,Fall 2018
95,Ardbeg Corryvreckan,57.1,Single Malt Scotch,90,"Part of the permanent Ardbeg range since 2008, Corryvreckan is created from a blend of standard Ardbeg and Ardbeg aged in virgin French Limousin oak casks. Smoky bacon and seaweed, plus dark berries, prickly spices, walnuts, lemon, and sweet peat on the nose. Sweet and savory on the palate, with more lively spice, woodsmoke, phenols, and licorice. The finish is lengthy, with peat, sea salt, pepper, and black coffee. <em>Editors’ Choice</em>",Gavin Smith,Fall 2018
95,Royal Salute 28 year old Kew Palace Edition,40,Blended Scotch Whisky,790,"Fresh spring floral bouquets, white peach, and nectarine tumble with sweet caramel, dried cherry, white chocolate, fresh linen notes, and vanilla cake batter. Silky smooth with fresh summer fruits, the strong peppery spices push to the fore, but this is nimble, graceful, and displays a real lightness. Compelling, captivating blending for the Flask Collection by Sandy Hyslop, this has a fragrance you could enjoy all night.",Jonny McCormick,Fall 2018
95,Kentucky Owl Rye 11 year old (Batch 1),55.3,Rye Whiskey,130,"Just beautiful. Long, rounded notes of caramel, cinnamon roll, taffy, butterscotch, brisket burnt ends, nutmeg, Jamaican jerk, plum pudding, ginger, light sassafras, root beer, roasted marshmallow, cotton candy, orange peel, raw honey, and pie crust. If it sounds complex, it’s because it is, and the finish just doesn’t quit, giving you a lingering taste of every note.",Fred Minnick,Summer 2018
95,Midleton Dair Ghaelach Bluebell Forest,55.3,Irish Single Pot Still,300,"Season 2 of Dair Ghaelach sees the action switch to six Irish oaks felled in a County Kilkenny bluebell forest. The balance of spice, toasted oak, and sweetness on the nose from tree one is singularly good, though clementine and grapefruit peel also clamor for attention. The acidity of the citrus collides with crunchy pot still spices, and grapefruit evolves into the most delicious ripe mango flavor. Simply heavenly.",Jonny McCormick,Spring 2018
95,The Balvenie 1973 43 year old,46.6,Single Malt Scotch,"15,000 or $60,000/set","This expression was matured in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. Overtly sherried, with figs, sultanas, cinnamon, and old warm leather on the nose. Finally, fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. The Turkish delight carries over to the palate, before the chocolate darkens to plain, with raisins, smoked ham, and cloves in the long finish. Remarkably, almost no tannic oak. Textbook stuff.",Gavin Smith,Spring 2018
95, William Larue Weller (Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2017),64.1,Bourbon/Tennessee,90,"This is a work of art. It begins by revealing vanilla, from custard to cake icing. Then it speaks caramel with a dark chew, crème brûlée, and Werther’s Original hard candy. From here, complexity takes over, with candied popcorn, butterscotch, chocolate ganache, French toast, maple, honey, pumpkin pie, fried pie dough, blueberries, and cinnamon, with hints of molasses and pecan. The long finish seems to offer a concentration of all the flavors. Delicious. Editor&#039;s Choice.",Fred Minnick,Winter 2017
96,Canadian Club Chronicles 42 year old The Dock Man,45,Canadian,270,"The Chronicles collection debuted two years ago with the release of the 40 year old. This, the third annual release, incorporates a smidgen of younger rye and a dash of brandy. The nose and palate are deep and complex.

96,Forty Creek 22 year old Rye,43,Canadian,168,"Remarkably flavorful, with linen, oilcloth, dragon fruit, hints of cereal, dark fruits, warm peppers, creamy rye spices, vague chocolate, and coffee.

96,William Larue Weller 12 year old (2018 Buffalo Trace Antique Collection),62.85,Bourbon/Tennessee,99,"Tilled earth, tobacco, and leather meet clover honey, maple syrup, and pecan pie sweetness. It pours broad and mouth-coating across the palate, with a lovely softness and pervasive vanilla and apple sweetness, gently tugged at by oaky tannins and more tobacco leaf. A touch floral and gently spiced, with cinnamon leading the way. Overall, this exudes beautiful balance right through the long finish that resonates both prettily and powerfully with dried citrus. <em>Collectible</em>",Jeffery Lindenmuth,Winter 2018
96,Bushmills 21 year old,40,Irish Single Malt,150,"Bushmills’ sumptuous magnum opus spins aromas of sultana, brown sugar, walnut oil, date slice, chocolate-covered cranberries, leather gloves, and a hint of espresso. The dark, crepuscular mystique continues in the syrupy mouthfeel redolent of forest honey, banana bread, nuts, browned butter, sultana, date, and blackberry. Utterly beguiling, the Madeira finish works wonders here, right through to the last moments of the smooth, sweet finish. A must-try for all.",Jonny McCormick,Winter 2018
96,Canadian Club Chronicles Issue No. 1 Water of Windsor 41 year old,45,Canadian,300,"Recently, a new “oldest Canadian whisky ever,” appears every year. In 2018, the honor goes to Canadian Club. Cedar lumber, fresh apricots, hints of bonfire, and sweet applewood on the nose. On the palate it’s butter tarts with vanilla, waves of pepper, pears, peaches, bonfire notes, and hints of pipe tobacco.
